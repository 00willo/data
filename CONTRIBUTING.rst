CONTRIBUTING
============

Contributions are welcome, and they are greatly appreciated! Every little bit
helps, and credit will always be given.

You can contribute in many ways:


Types of Contributions
======================

Report Bugs
-----------

Report bugs at:

https://github.com/pytube/data/issues

If you are reporting a bug about incorrect data, please include:

* The directory, file or files that are relevant.
* The data that is incorrect.
* Values for the corrected data if you can provide them.

If you are reporting a bug about things to add, please include:

* The name of the thing to add (the conference name, the user group name, etc).
* A description of the thing.
* Any urls where we can find additional details about the thing.
* The url for the video material.

.. Note::

   Please remember that this is a volunteer-driven project!

   All work is done on a volunteer basis, so if you write up an issue, it may
   sit there for a while.

   If you see an issue you can help with, please pitch in! If you don't, don't
   expect anyone else to, either.


Write Documentation
-------------------

Our documentation can always be better. What questions did you have that you
think other people might have that aren't answered in the documentation? Were
you able to find what you were looking for? Was documentation in weird
unexpected places? Are there typos? Are examples helpful? Are examples missing?

We could always use more documentation whether that's part of the official docs,
comments and docstrings in the code or even elsewhere on the web in blog posts,
articles, tweets and other things like that.
