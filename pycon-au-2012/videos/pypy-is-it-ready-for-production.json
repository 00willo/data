  "description": "I have followed the development of PyPy since 2004 and played with\nvarious releases to see what the PyPy team had achieved. It wasn't until\nthe release of PyPy 1.18 that I actually ran some existing production\npython code under it. The perceived performance improvement of this\nexercise inspired me to implement a more scientific method for comparing\nthe runtime performance of CPython and PyPy running various Python\nproduction code sets that we use in the company I work for. This\npresentation will discuss the results of this comparison and the\npositives and negatives with utilising PyPy in production.\n",
