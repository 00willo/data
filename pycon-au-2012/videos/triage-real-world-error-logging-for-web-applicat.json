  "alias": "video/1629/triage-real-world-error-logging-for-web-applicat",
  "summary": "Modern web applications can quickly develop many moving parts. As they\ngrow in traffic, infrastructure, services and features, keeping track of\nerrors and communicating about them becomes more challenging.\n",
  "description": "In this talk we present Triage, a homegrown tool at 99designs for\naggregating and managing errors in a live production system. Although\nwritten in Python, Triage is designed to ingest errors in a language\nagnostic way. We describe our path from simpler logging techniques which\nwe outgrew, the new workflows around error management which it allows,\nand some challenges we faced along the way.\n",
