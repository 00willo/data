  "description": "<p>MicroPython has risen from a kickstarter campaign to a feature rich implementation of Python 3 on microcontrollers. The project is summarized in the following statement: \"MicroPython is a lean and efficient implementation of the Python 3 programming language that includes a small subset of the Python standard library and is optimised to run on microcontrollers and in constrained environments\" (http://micropython.org/). With IOT gaining more momentum daily and devices such as the ESP8266 (https://www.sparkfun.com/products/13678) now able to serve web pages, MicroPython is a viable candidate for fast prototyping and simple embedded devices.</p>\n<p>This talk will focus mainly on the ESP8266 &amp; Unix implementation of MicroPython. The ESP8266 is an amazing device, considering it is the size of a R5 coin and can run an implementation of Python. The talk will cover features, limitations and some simple ideas to get going. A demo of a simple Home Automation/IOT application with MicroPython &amp; the ESP8266 will also be included.</p>\n<p>This talk aims to bring the familiarity of Python 3 to developers, with the hope of encouraging hack-a-day type projects without extensive embedded device knowledge.</p>",
