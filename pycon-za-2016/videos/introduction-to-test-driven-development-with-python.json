  "description": "<p>Test driven development is a method of programming that has been talked about considerably over the past few years. It is a way of programming that aims to achieve good quality code, by specifying your problems through writing tests first. </p>\n<p>In my tutorial i will introduce the core concepts of TDD through creating a simple  web application using Python &amp; Django. I will explain in detail the TDD workflow. Attendees to this tutorial will be introduced to functional testing with Selenium and  to unit testing with the Python Standard Library`s unittest Module.</p>\n<p>My tutorial is aimed at beginners to Test Driven Development. I expect attendees to have some familiarity with python and Django.</p>",
