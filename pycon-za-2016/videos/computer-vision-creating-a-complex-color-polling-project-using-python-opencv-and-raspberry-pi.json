  "description": "<p>I will be talking about creating a computer vision classroom color poll sheet recognition project using Python, OpenCV and raspberry Pi. Specifically, looking at detecting color poll-sheets in a classroom of about 50 - 150 students. Much like how one can poll an audience of people using a clicker technology and show the results of the audience with regards to a question asked. </p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Audience is anyone interested in computer vision, what computer vision can do and achieve, as well as the hard work required to make it all happen.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>After the talk the audience can have a glimpse into what it takes to create a computer vision project, as well as the typical process and algorithm one would follow in a simple task of creating a computer vision project using python, opencv and raspberry pi. </p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>A few aspects I will cover include:\n        -  Computer vision goals \n        -  Simplified overview of the algorithm used \n        -  Going into a bit of detail where the challenges arise \n        -  Example of the the project i worked on\n        -  Results achieved\n        -  A few global interesting projects around computer vision</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I will end with a look into the python code involved and talk through the results of the polling program, as well as any hard to detect areas and how the system detects these. :)</p>",
