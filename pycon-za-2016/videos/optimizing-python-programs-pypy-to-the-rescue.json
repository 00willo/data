  "description": "<p>In this talk I want to show how you can use PyPy for your benefit.\nIt will kick off with a short introduction covering PyPy and its just in time\ncompiler. PyPy is the most advanced Python interpreter around\nand while it should generally just speed up your programs there is a wide range\nof performance that you can get out of PyPy.</p>\n<p>Throughout the talk some developer statements and big applications will motivate why PyPy is a viable option\nto optimize your Python programs. In addition I will present the companies value after switching to PyPy.</p>\n<p>The first part, will cover considerations why one should write Python programs,\nand only spend fractions of the development time to optimize your program.\nThe second part of this session will be about this small part\nof time: in cases where you need it, I'll show tools that help you inspect\nand change your program to improve it. We will also dive into one tool more elaborately.\nVMProf, a platform to inspect your program while it is running, imposing very little overhead.</p>\n<p>As a result of this talk, an audience member should be equipped with\ntools that helps him to understand performance issues and optimize programs.</p>",
