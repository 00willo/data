  "description": "<p>There has been a lot said about how to ensure correct quality control using tests, continuous integration, peer review etc. In this talk I would like to focus exclusively on my experience as an open source contributor with various projects. I've contributed extensively to projects I don't manage (like twisted, mercurial, cpython) and I've overseen contributions by others to projects like vmprof or PyPy. I would like to share my experience on how various methods (tests, reviews etc.) make me feel as a contributor and how easy it is to integrate changes based on that. I think the human factor of contributions is often too omitted from the process.</p>",
