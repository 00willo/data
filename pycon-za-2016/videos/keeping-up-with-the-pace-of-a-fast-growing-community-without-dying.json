  "description": "<p>New open source communities are born everyday. Some of them are meant to last long and some others aren't. There's a moment in every community where it needs to outgrow itself, expand its limits and aim way higher than ever. This is no necesarily related to its goals but the ecosystem it needs to stay alive.</p>\n<p>Once a community has gone beyond its limits, the community members, consumers and leaders will have to keep up with its pace. How do we help it to remain sane? How do we keep our goals on track while allowing for further growth? How do we allow it to keep expanding without further damaging the community?</p>\n<p>These are all questions we ask ourselves everyday in the OpenStack community and that we've managed to work on without killing ourselves on the way.</p>",
