  "description": "<p>Brand-new challenges have arisen in the field of three-dimensional space and form, such as; architecture, geometry, material, and even energy, which requires in thorough investigation and understanding of the outcomes to discover optimum design solutions. However, without this understanding, analysis and the overlay of interactive data seems impossible and fanciful. Although it was not possible to analyse and use data in traditional architecture, today it is getting real to do with the large volumes of information such as, annual climatic data, sun positions, environmental data, energy data etc. </p>\n<p>Python is the most adaptable and robust program which we use to analyse, overlay and optimise data in the field of architecture. We want to understand how it works in a three-dimensional program such as Rhino and how it can help us to develop our ideas and utilise the recent architectural design methodology, which is known as parametric architecture, or algorithmic architecture.</p>\n<p>We will demonstrate 3 different experiences in the fields of; geometry, energy, and optimization, and what the approach of each is. Python aids the design of architectural elements through the relation of form to and data simulations. This would be of interest to those who want to see the future of algorithmic design for; architects, designers, and programmers. There is no experience needed, we just want to express the enjoyment these tools can add to three-dimensional design.</p>",
