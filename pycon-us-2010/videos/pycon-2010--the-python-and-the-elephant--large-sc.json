  "description": "The Python and the Elephant: Large Scale Natural Language Processing\nwith NLTK and Dumbo\n\nPresented by Nitin Madnani (University of Maryland, College Park); Dr.\nJimmy J Lin (University of Maryland)\n\nA practical look at NLTK and Dumbo, python-powered and open-source\ntoolkits and APIs for processing natural language on a large scale.\n\nFor people like us who make a living trying to make a computer\n\"understand\" human language, Python is a very powerful language, given\nits rapid prototyping abilities, native unicode support and a stellar\nstandard library. This relationship has been strengthened further by an\nopen-source, python- based Natural Language ToolKit\n(`www.nltk.org <http://www.nltk.org/>`__) which is being widely used in\nthe community for both teaching and research purposes and gaining\ntraction in the general Python community as well\n(`www.nltk.org/book <http://www.nltk.org/book>`__). Recently, the Python\ncommunity has seen the release of Dumbo\n(`http://wiki.github.com/klbostee/dumb\no <http://wiki.github.com/klbostee/dumbo>`__), an open-source,\npython-based cloud-computing API (based on Hadoop) via the hands of\nKlaas Bosteels.\n\nIn this talk, we show how the amalgamation of Python, NLTK and Dumbo can\nallow for very large-scale natural language processing efficiently and\nelegantly.\n",
