  "description": "Pay only for what you eat: A tour of the Repoze.BFG repository and\nphilosophy\n\nPresented by Carlos de la Guardia\n\nBFG is a Python web application framework based on WSGI. It is a \"pay\nonly for what you eat\" framework. Meaning that you can get started\neasily and learn new concepts as you go, and only if you need them. It's\nsimple, well tested, well documented, and fast. It also tries to make\ndevelopment fun.\n\nThis talk will introduce the framework and its philosophy, including\nsimilarities and differences with other frameworks. I will then show\nsome of the software available in its repository and discuss the\ninclusive, loose connection approach that the BFG community prefers for\ncreating a flexible web development platform.\n",
