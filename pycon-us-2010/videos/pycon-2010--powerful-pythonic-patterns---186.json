Maybe the meme springs from not realizing what the\nGang Of Four state so plainly in their historical \"Design Patterns\" book:\nwhich design patterns are useful DOES depend on the programming language one\ntargets -- design is NOT independent of implementation, as the epic-fail\n\"Waterfall\" Methodology Pattern would suggest. If you examine a \"classic DP\"\nthat's basically a workaround for some other language's lack of garbage\ncollection, or for a clumsy static-typing system, it may indeed be worthless\nfor Python. But many other DPs are still perfectly useful and applicable, and\nindeed Python's strengths as a language afford riffing on them to develop\nhighly Pythonic, powerful, productive variants.\n\nIn this talk, I analyze some of my favorite pattern families -- e.g., Template\nMethod and its variants, Dependency Injection and its ilk, Callback and\nfriends -- in a highly Pythonic context. Non-pattern Idioms, and Patterns that\naren't really Design Patterns but rather Architecture or Methodology ones,\nalso make cameo appearances.\n\n", "video_mp4_url": "http://05d2db1380b6504cc981-8cbed8cf7e3a131cd8f1c3e383d10041.r93.cf2.rackcdn.com/pycon-us-2010/275_powerful-pythonic-patterns-186.m4v", "tags": ["designpatterns", "pycon", "pycon2010", "python-advanced"], "copyright_text": "Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 3.0", "related_urls": [], "video_flv_download_only": false, "source_url": "", "video_webm_url": null, "video_ogv_length": null, "video_ogv_url": "http://05d2db1380b6504cc981-8cbed8cf7e3a131cd8f1c3e383d10041.r93.cf2.rackcdn.com/pycon-us-2010/275_powerful-pythonic-patterns-186.ogv", "language": "English", "video_webm_length": null, "summary": "", "thumbnail_url": "http://a.images.blip.tv/Pycon-PyCon2010PowerfulPythonicPatterns186111-668.jpg", "video_flv_url": null}
