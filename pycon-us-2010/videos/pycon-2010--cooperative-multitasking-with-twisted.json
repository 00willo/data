It\nalso provides powerful tools for writing non-blocking non-network code, tools\nwhich are vital for building real large scale applications in Twisted. I hope\nto give a comprehensive overview of these tools to help the intermediate\nTwisted user get things done concurrently.\n\n  \n[VIDEO HAS ISSUES: Picture out of focus at the beginning]\n\n", "video_mp4_url": "http://05d2db1380b6504cc981-8cbed8cf7e3a131cd8f1c3e383d10041.r93.cf2.rackcdn.com/pycon-us-2010/268_cooperative-multitasking-with-twisted-getting-things-done-concurrently-11.m4v", "tags": ["pycon", "pycon2010", "twisted"], "copyright_text": "Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 3.0", "related_urls": [], "video_flv_download_only": false, "source_url": "", "video_webm_url": null, "video_ogv_length": 162419672, "video_ogv_url": "http://05d2db1380b6504cc981-8cbed8cf7e3a131cd8f1c3e383d10041.r93.cf2.rackcdn.com/pycon-us-2010/268_cooperative-multitasking-with-twisted-getting-things-done-concurrently-11.ogv", "language": "English", "video_webm_length": null, "summary": "", "thumbnail_url": "http://a.images.blip.tv/Pycon-PyCon2010CooperativeMultitaskingWithTwistedGettingThingsD951-91.jpg", "video_flv_url": null}
