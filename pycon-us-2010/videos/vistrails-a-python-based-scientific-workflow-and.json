  "description": "VisTrails: A Python-Based Scientific Workflow and Provenance System\n\nPresented by David Koop (University of Utah and VisTrails, Inc.)\n\nIn this talk, we will give an overview of VisTrails\n(`http://www.vistrails.org <http://www.vistrails.org/>`__), a\npython-based open- source scientific workflow that transparently\ncaptures provenance (i.e., lineage) of both data products and the\nprocesses used to derive these products. We will show how VisTrails can\nbe used to streamline data exploration and visualization. Using real\nexamples, we will demonstrate key features of the system, including the\nability to visually create information processing pipelines that combine\nmultiple tools and Iibraries such as VTK, pylab, and matplotlib. We will\nalso show how VisTrails leverages provenance information not only to\nsupport result reproducibility, but also to simplify the creation and\nrefinement of pipelines.\n",
