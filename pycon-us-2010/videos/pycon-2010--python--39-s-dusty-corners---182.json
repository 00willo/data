The list includes how\ncomparisons work, descriptors, iterators, context managers, namespaces, else\nclauses on for/while loops (suggested by Hettinger). The narrative of the talk\nis that these are features that you don't need and/or shouldn't use in your\nday-to-day code but that you need to keep in the back of your mind because\nother people's code and the stdlib do use them. As Alex Martelli pointed out\nin his wonderful talk \"Abstractions as Leverage\" you can't successfully\nfunction at one level of abstraction if you don't know what is going on at the\nnext level down. This talk is a whirlwind tour of the next level down.\n\n", "video_mp4_url": "http://05d2db1380b6504cc981-8cbed8cf7e3a131cd8f1c3e383d10041.r93.cf2.rackcdn.com/pycon-us-2010/351_python-s-dusty-corners-182.m4v", "tags": ["contextmanagers", "descripters", "else", "iterators", "namespaces", "pycon", "pycon2010"], "copyright_text": "Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 3.0", "related_urls": [], "video_flv_download_only": false, "source_url": "", "video_webm_url": null, "video_ogv_length": 137194246, "video_ogv_url": "http://05d2db1380b6504cc981-8cbed8cf7e3a131cd8f1c3e383d10041.r93.cf2.rackcdn.com/pycon-us-2010/351_python-s-dusty-corners-182.ogv", "language": "English", "video_webm_length": null, "summary": "", "thumbnail_url": "http://a.images.blip.tv/Pycon-PyCon2010PythonsDustyCorners182155.png", "video_flv_url": null}
