  "description": "Python 101\n\nPresented by Stuart Williams\n\nThis half-day tutorial presents the basics of Python to beginning and\nintermediate programmers. It pairs well with ''Python 102'' which\nfollows a similar outline but goes much deeper.\n\nRather than starting with \"Hello, world!\", we use the interactive Python\ninterpreter shell to get hands-on familiarity with much of core Python\nbefore covering blocks and scripts.\n\nThe tutorial is divided into short sections, each with presentation and\nhands- on exercises, to quickly cover lots of ground.\n\nAdvanced topics are introduced throughout and covered in \"extra credit\"\nexercises such that more advanced participants can learn at their own\npace.\n\nIntended Audience\n\nProgrammers with experience in other languages who want a fast hands-on\nintroduction to Python. Content will target both Python 3.1 and 2.6.\n\nRequirements\n\nBring a laptop computer with Python 2.6 or 3.1 installed. Try to get as\nmuch of an overview of Python before the tutorial as you have time to in\norder to get more out of the tutorial. Two angles on this are the Python\nQuick Reference and the Python website's tutorial.\n\nClass Outline\n\n-  Numbers and operators\n-  Strings - immutability, operators, methods, functions, and formatting\n-  Introspection/Discovery\n-  Tuples and Lists\n-  List Comprehensions\n-  Objects and Names\n-  Dictionaries\n-  Loops and Blocks\n-  Iterables\n-  Generator Expressions\n-  Functions\n-  Generators\n-  Namespaces\n-  Simple Classes\n-  Exceptions\n\nThe handouts at\n`http://swilliams.ca/python-tutorials <http://swilliams.ca%20/python-tutorials>`__.\nIf you're interested in the software I wrote to deliver the talk drop me\na line. My address is in the handouts.\n",
