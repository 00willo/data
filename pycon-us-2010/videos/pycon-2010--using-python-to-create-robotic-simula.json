  "description": "Using Python to Create Robotic Simulations for Planetary Exploration\n(#159)\n\nPresented by Dr. Jonathan M Cameron (Jet Propulsion Laboratory (NASA))\n\nThe primary activity of the Dartslab (http://dartslab.jpl.nasa.gov) at\nJet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) is to create simulations of robotic\nvehicles for planetary exploration. We have created simulations of a\nwide variety of robotic vehicles such as spacecraft, rovers, and\nairships. We have been using Python in a variety of ways to build our\nsimulations. In this talk we will outline how we use Python to set up a\nruntime environment for our simulations and to tie together\ncomputationally intense C++ code modules at runtime. We will also\ndiscuss how we have been using Python to help prototype and design C++\ncode.\n",
