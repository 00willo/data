Fletcher (VRPlumber Consulting Inc.)\n\n  \nPyCon is about staying up all night hacking. When you're tired, you don't\nsleep, you debate ideas with your sprint-mates! This presentation will attempt\nto condense the best of the last few years of PyGTA into a 30-minute jumping\noff point full of wild assertions, unreasonable assumptions, and just plain\nwrong-headed ideas to kick-start those heated discussions that just keep going\nlong into the night. What are your programming mantras? What million-dollar\nideas do you have to improve Python? Should there be programmer liability? Is\nthere art in programming and should there be? Are you a cowboy coder or an\nstraight-laced engineer? Is PyCon really about staying up all night discussing\nideas? We'll have a feedback channel to share your thoughts, we'll keep it\nmoving, and we'll see if we can't make this the most sleepless PyCon yet.\n\n", "video_mp4_url": "http://05d2db1380b6504cc981-8cbed8cf7e3a131cd8f1c3e383d10041.r93.cf2.rackcdn.com/pycon-us-2010/314_debating-til-dawn-topics-to-keep-you-up-all-night-183.m4v", "tags": ["pycon", "pycon2010"], "copyright_text": "Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 3.0", "related_urls": [], "video_flv_download_only": false, "source_url": "", "video_webm_url": null, "video_ogv_length": 96732258, "video_ogv_url": "http://05d2db1380b6504cc981-8cbed8cf7e3a131cd8f1c3e383d10041.r93.cf2.rackcdn.com/pycon-us-2010/314_debating-til-dawn-topics-to-keep-you-up-all-night-183.ogv", "language": "English", "video_webm_length": null, "summary": "", "thumbnail_url": "http://a.images.blip.tv/Pycon-PyCon2010DebatingTilDawnTopicsToKeepYouUpAllNight183772.png", "video_flv_url": null}
