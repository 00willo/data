  "description": "We'll explore areas outside QWERTY keyboard layout most of us are born\ninto. And we'll build tools to help us expand that (layout) universe and\nunderstand it better using python. We'll go over my history of creating\nand using my custom keyboard layout (dvorak variant), how I designed and\nimproved it over time, and how I confidently know it's better for me.\n",
