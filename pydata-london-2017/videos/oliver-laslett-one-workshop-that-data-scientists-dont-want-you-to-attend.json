  "description": "By Oliver Laslett & Andraz Hribernik\n\nFilmed at PyData London 2017\n\nDescription\nWith this one weird trick you can build a text processing pipeline!\n\nWe've all fallen for clickbait articles online. They pollute our news feeds and make it harder to filter out valuable information. In this workshop we'll stream news articles in real-time and detect clickbait using simple machine learning techniques. You won't believe what happened next...\n\nAbstract\nBy the end of the workshop you'll have your very own python app for streaming real-time news and detecting click bait. In the workshop we'll cover: - Streaming data from a REST API - Preprocessing textual data - Training a simple machine learning classifier for clickbait - Putting everything together in a scikit-learn pipeline - Analysing our results (which news source is the most clickbaity?)\n\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is a gathering of users and developers of data analysis tools in Python. The goals are to provide Python enthusiasts a place to share ideas and learn from each other about how best to apply our language and tools to ever-evolving challenges in the vast realm of data management, processing, analytics, and visualization.\n\nWe aim to be an accessible, community-driven conference, with tutorials for novices, advanced topical workshops for practitioners, and opportunities for package developers and users to meet in person.",
