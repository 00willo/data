  "description": "Filmed at PyData London 2017\n\nDescription\nThis talk will be an exposition of machine learning with random forests for Python programmers. The talk will cover the internals of how random forests are implemented, applications that are well suited to the use of random forests, and Python code samples to demonstrate their use.\n\nAbstract\nOutline\nIntro (5 minutes)\nWhat are random forests, how are they used, and what Python software is available for using them?\nWhat strengths do they have relative to other models (scalability and applicability to a broad range of problems)?\nForest Internals (15 minutes)\nDecision Trees (5 minutes)\nPresentation of the decision tree model, the building block of random forests.\nEntropy Minimization (5 minutes)\nExplanation of how decision trees are tuned using entropy minimization.\nBuilding Forests from Decision Trees (5 minutes)\nExplanation of how decision trees are aggregated to form random forests.\nIllustrative Examples (10 minutes)\nRegression on non-linear functions (5 minutes)\nClassification with unscaled features (5 minutes)\n\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is a gathering of users and developers of data analysis tools in Python. The goals are to provide Python enthusiasts a place to share ideas and learn from each other about how best to apply our language and tools to ever-evolving challenges in the vast realm of data management, processing, analytics, and visualization.\n\nWe aim to be an accessible, community-driven conference, with tutorials for novices, advanced topical workshops for practitioners, and opportunities for package developers and users to meet in person.",
