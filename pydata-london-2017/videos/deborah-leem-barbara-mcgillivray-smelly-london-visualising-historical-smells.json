  "description": "Filmed at PyData London 2017\n\nDescription\nSmelly London project brings together historical data with modern digitisation and visualisation to give us a unique, revealing and visceral glimpse into a London of the past and what it tells us about London today. This is a collaborative, interdisciplinary project to demonstrate the capabilities of innovative text mining tools we design to facilitate new kinds of humanities research.\n\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is a gathering of users and developers of data analysis tools in Python. The goals are to provide Python enthusiasts a place to share ideas and learn from each other about how best to apply our language and tools to ever-evolving challenges in the vast realm of data management, processing, analytics, and visualization.\n\nWe aim to be an accessible, community-driven conference, with tutorials for novices, advanced topical workshops for practitioners, and opportunities for package developers and users to meet in person.",
