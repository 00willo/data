  "description": "Filmed at PyData London 2017 \n\nDescription\nI will show the tools and processes for building interactive web apps using the Jupyter stack. Simple, easy, beautiful.\n\nAbstract\nJupyter is great for tinkering and research. But what if you are not the only consumer of that notebook? What if other consumers want to slice and visualise your data differently? I will show how to turn fresh ideas or existing Jupyter notebooks into beautiful web apps without the need to worry about the web server, HTTP and content deployment.\n\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is a gathering of users and developers of data analysis tools in Python. The goals are to provide Python enthusiasts a place to share ideas and learn from each other about how best to apply our language and tools to ever-evolving challenges in the vast realm of data management, processing, analytics, and visualization.\n\nWe aim to be an accessible, community-driven conference, with tutorials for novices, advanced topical workshops for practitioners, and opportunities for package developers and users to meet in person.",
