  Taking the title from the seminal philosphy of mind paper by Thomas
  Nagel (What is it like to be a Bat (1974)) this talk looks at the
  problems surrounding Artificial Intelligence, illustrated with examples
  from my own artistic practice.

  What do we mean by intelligence? How do the limitations of language
  leave us floundering with regards to discussing our relationship with
  ‘algorithms’ and emerging machine intelligence? I argue that the
  limitations in the discourse surrounding AI are remarkably similar to
  the problems found in psychology and philosophy relating to other minds.

  Much has been said about the forthcoming ‘singularity’, but little
  attention is being paid to the signals and signs already emerging on
  this path. My artworks play in this space, highlighting the potentials
  and limitations inherent in existing technologies and questioning our
  relationship with the world of bots.

  We already live in an algorithmically mediated world, though in many
  ways we remain blind to the ramifications. The world of the future will
  be teeming with intelligent systems, though they may not conform to our
  narrow anthropomorphic perspective on what intelligence is. For us to
  prepare for the future, perhaps we need to change the way we think about
  thinking, just as the machines are changing theirs.
