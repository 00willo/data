  At least 30% of people seeking support at a Citizens Advice office are repeat visitors. If we better understand the relationships between these problems, would it be possible to offer preventive advice, and thereby reduce cost and provide a better service? DataKind UK worked with Citizens Advice to find out.

  DataKind UK works with charities across the country to help them harness
  the power of data science. We recently ran a year-long project with
  Citizens Advice. As you probably know, Citizens Advice offers
  confidential, impartial advice and support on a number of day-to-day
  issues ranging from claiming benefits to faulty goods. DataKind UK
  helped the organisation pull together and understand their disparate
  data sets to get a better picture of the emerging social problems that
  people in the UK face. Here is one small part of that project...

  On average, 5,700 people walk into their local Citizens Advice Bureau
  every single day. Of these people, at least 30% are repeat visitors.
  They come in seeking advice with one problem, and return months later
  with a different problem. If we could better understand the
  relationships between these problems, could Citizens Advice offer
  preventive advice, and thereby reduce cost and provide a better service?
  That's what we sought to find out. Using Python, Scipy, Networkx, Spyre
  and D3.js, Billy Wong, a DataKind UK volunteer worked to tackle this
  problem. Come to our talk to see the result!
