summary: |-
  Deep Learning is an exciting trend in machine learning, where neural
  networks of many layers “deep” can automatically learn features from
  large volumes of data, setting new standards for image, audio and
  language understanding. In this interactive session we will go over
  some of the most popular python libraries for deep learning and will
  train an actual deep neural nets end to end.

  Deep Learning is an exciting trend in machine learning, where neural
  networks of many layers “deep” can automatically learn features from
  large volumes of data, in turn setting new standards for audio, image,
  and language understanding, machine translation, object and face
  recognition, etc.

  The talk will start with a short overview of Deep Learning, both the
  deserved praise, as well as some of its criticisms, and explain some of
  the ways in which both text and vision data can be represented within a
  single united model. Such a single model has not only amazingly accurate
  results for existing language and vision tasks, but also offers new
  possibilities for business and society at large.

  In the second portion of the talk I will tell a bit about how one would
  go about training a deep neural net for the first time, and what are
  some of the established practices to follow. We will go over one or more
  of the most widely used python packages (theano, pylearn, caffe) which
  enable machine learning enthusiasts to easily prototype and run deep
  architectures. Aided by iPython notebook(s) we will do some live coding
  to create and run a deep neural net, and see how it performs in the wild
  on a language or vision task.
