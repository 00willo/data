  There are many specialised tools to visualise geographic data. However,
  they are often expensive and have a significant learning curve. Free
  libraries in Python and R, enable users to not only work with shapefiles
  but also perform a variety of exploratory analyses and visualisations.
  In this talk we will look at London road works data and we use a variety
  of libraries in Python and R to analyse and create thematic maps. We
  will comment on ease of use and advantages/disadvantages of each
  ecosystem when it comes to novice users.
