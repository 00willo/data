summary: |-
  A tutorial covering some general concepts of geospatial data, main
  formats in which it is distributed and some common places where this
  data can be acquired. We will also learn how to read, process and
  visualise this data using Python and QGIS. This talk will cover some
  typical problems one can experience when working with geospatial
  data.
