  In this talk we will give an introduction to Agent-Based Modelling (ABM)
  using Python. ABM is a technique used to build simulated populations of
  heterogeneous individuals that are governed by rules of behaviour. These
  individuals, or agents, interact in simulated environments in which we
  study their emergent behaviour. We build agent-based models in order to
  try explain why people do what they do. In this talk, we'll briefly show
  how we develop and validate agent populations. We will then present
  on-going work modelling the 2011 London riots, investigating how riots
  spread and in particular focussing on police response. Finally, we’ll
  discuss why we use Python and the PyData stack to develop models, and
  mention how we are starting to use machine learning (scikit-learn) for
  learning rules of behaviour.
