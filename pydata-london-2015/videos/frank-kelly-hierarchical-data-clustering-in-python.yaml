  Clustering of data is an increasingly important task for many data scientists. This talk will explore the challenge of hierarchical clustering of text data for summarisation purposes. We'll take a look at some great solutions now available to Python users including the relevant Scikit Learn libraries, via Elasticsearch (with the carrot2 plugin), and check out visualisations from both approaches.
