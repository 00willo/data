  We use Bokeh, Pandas and a bit of Apache Spark for addressing the
  flexibility, performance / data volume requirements of standard
  financial risk management processes. The coded examples illustrate the
  model calibration and backtesting processes of a market risk model (VaR
  Filtered Historical Simulation), which quantifies possible future losses
  arising from market price movements.
abstract_original: |
  Financial institutions regularly estimate possible portfolio losses
  arising from (future) changes in the market values of their assets, e.g.
  using the Value at Risk (VaR) metric. We show a VaR model using Filtered
  Historical Simulation and illustrate some of the usual processes for
  calibrating, validating and analysing these models, such as calibration
  and backtesting. Although the model is relatively simple, the challenges
  posed by their different requirements - flexibility, data volume,
  performance - inevitably lead to many shortcuts and complexity. With the
  ultimate goal of managing this complexity, we explore and evaluate, with
  concrete coded examples, the PyData (e.g. Pandas, Bokeh) and Apache
  Spark frameworks from a practitioner's point of view.
