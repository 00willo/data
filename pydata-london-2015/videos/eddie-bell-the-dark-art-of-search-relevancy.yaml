summary: |-
  Building a search engine is a dark art that is made even more
  difficult by the nebulous ever-changing concept of search relevancy.
  When, and to what degree, is a result deemed to be relevant for a
  given search term? In this talk I will describe how we built a Lyst
  search relevancy data set using heuristics, crowd-sourcing and Xbox
  Live matchmaking.

  Search is a hard area to work in. Techniques are not made public due to
  their value and little academic work is done in the area. Furthermore,
  Google has made the exceptional an everyday experience so the bar for
  success is very high from the outset.

  Search data sets are also hard to create due to the nebulous
  ever-changing concept of search relevancy. When, and to what degree, is
  a result deemed to be relevant for a given search term? The
  ElasticSearch documentation states it well: *" Search relevancy tuning
  is a rabbit hole that you can easily fall into and never emerge"*.

  In this presentation I'll give a introduction to building a search
  relevancy data set with python using crowd-sourcing and the Trueskill
  algorithm from Microsoft. Trueskill is used for matchmaking on XBox Live
  and it allows us to transform moderated pairwise comparisons into
  rankings. The rankings can then be used to learn what results best match
  a given search phrase. I'll briefly cover how we're modeling the
  moderated rankings at Lyst using deep learning.
