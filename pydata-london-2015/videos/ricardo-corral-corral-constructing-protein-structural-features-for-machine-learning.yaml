description: |
  Proteins are the most abundant macromolecules on cells. They perform a
  wide range of biological activities due to its adopted three dimensional
  structures. First requirement to make use of Machine Learning
  technologies on this context, is to construct an informative set of
  features for representing protein structures. We make use of the Residue
  Cluster Class System, a labeled Sperner Family arising from atomic
  positions, giving a total set of 26 features. Practical applications are
  presented for various classical computational biology tasks. Entire code
  base is implemented on Python as an API and ready to use final user
  programs.
