  Are you used to running your models on a laptop? Do you want to know how
  to run it in a production environment? Well, grab a coffee, put your
  slippers on and prepare yourself for a whirlwind tour of what it takes
  to run a model 24/7. Specifically, we'll be looking at Bloomberg's
  European Utility Market Model (EUMM) infrastructure for running models
  that depend on weather supplied by Weather Services International (WSI).
