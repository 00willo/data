  20 young coders with smartphones pre-loaded with an app that gathered data on the network activity of the other apps they used. Their data was captured using the Python-based data portal CKAN, analysed with SciKit-Learn, then returned to them using Docker and the Ipython Notebook. Python also played a role in the reverse-engineering of some of the more interesting apps we discovered.

  The "`Our Data, Ourselves <http://big-social-data.net/>`__" project
  seeks to explore the possibility of making the data-trails of smartphone
  users available ethically in a "social data commons". We issued 20 young
  coders from `Young Rewired State <http://www.yrs.io/>`__ with Android
  smartphones pre- loaded with an
  `app <http://kingsbsd.github.io/MobileMiner/>`__ that tracked their
  other apps' network usage and recorded commonly captured data. This was
  collected using the Python-based data portal
  `CKAN <http://ckan.org/>`__, the advantages and pitfalls of which will
  be discussed. Users' GSM cell-tower locations from the
  `OpenCellId <http://opencellid.org/>`__ database were clustered using
  k-means via SciKit-Learn. Careful feature-vector selection yielded deep
  insights into their everyday lives. This helped provoke discussions with
  the participants about their understanding of privacy related to their
  mobile app usage. We held a hack-day to return their data to them using
  a Docker container wrapping a copy of the CKAN instance that could be
  queried through an Ipython Notebook. Further details about the users'
  apps were obtained by scraping the Google PlayStore, which presented
  some challenges. Apps with particularly interesting patterns of network
  usage were reverse-engineered and their network traffic captured. We
  have run a "masterclass" on Android app reversal supported by
  `distributing software
  tools <http://kingsbsd.github.io/DroidDestructionKit/>`__ in another
  Docker container, many of them Python-based. The final phase of our
  project will be conducted in conjunction with the `Open Data
  Institute <http://opendatainstitute.org/>`__, integrating our app with
  M.I.T's `Open Personal Data Store <http://openpds.media.mit.edu/>`__,
  also written in Python, to give its users greater granularity of control
  as to how their data is used.
