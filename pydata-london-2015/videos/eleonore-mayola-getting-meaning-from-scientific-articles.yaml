  The bibliography process is necessary part of biomedical science, but
  researchers also tend to find it boring! For it to be less time
  consuming it would be interesting to automate part of the process.
  Here Python machine learning libraries can help to determine whether
  a research article is worth reading!

  The bibliography process means every scientist regularly has to go
  through a lot of published articles in parallel to her/his research. The
  aim is to:

  - know what other researchers are doing: they might be ahead
    of you, they might have proven your project is a dead end.
  - get some context to interpret your research results.

  Using specialised search engines can be inefficient if you don't use
  the "right" keywords. Researcher also tend to find bibliography
  boring so it would be interesting to automate part of the process!

  In my talk I'll answer the following question:

  - can Python machine learning libraries (nltk, scikit-learn) be used
    to determine whether a research article is worth reading?

  I'll use the TF-IDF measure to identify frequent topics appearing in
  specific scientific articles and train a classifier to distinguish
  between relevant and non-relevant articles depending and someone's
  interests.
