  The Bokeh data visualization library allows you to build interactive visualizations for the web in python. This training gives a quick introduction to Bokeh's unique features. We'll do exercixes building up a variety of visualizations and finish discussing topics and questions from participants related to their own datasets & needs.

  The `Bokeh data visualization library <http://bokeh.pydata.org/>`__
  allows you to build interactive visualizations for the web in python. It
  has a range of capabilities from quick "one-line" charts to streaming
  datasets to integrating with your existing plot libraries such as
  matplotlib or ggplot.

  This training gives a quick hands-on introduction to Bokeh's core
  features. We'll do exercises building up a variety of visualizations and
  finish up discussing topics and questions from participants related to
  their own datasets & needs.

  This is the planned outline:

  -  (20 minutes) Bokeh feature walk-through. The relationship between
     bokeh, bokehjs and bokeh-server. The various API levels of bokeh
     (models, plotting, charts). And, examples of a variety of
     visualizations.

  -  (20 minutes): Exercises - 1 - The charts & plotting interface. Get
     quickly plotting in an ipython notebook. Different types of data
     accepted, and how to customize a plot.

  -  (10 minutes): Tips for navigating the Bokeh docs and examples as
     you're getting up to speed.

  -  (20 minutes): Exercises - 2 - (a) The models interface. Build a
     custom plot from the ground up using the Models API. (b) Quick, yet
     custom, using the charts interface and models together.

  -  (10 minutes): Sharing your plots. Overview of the different ways to
     share your plots with your colleagues and the world.

  -  (20 minutes): Exercises - 3 - Add custom interactivity - Customize
     your hover and selections. Implement linked selection, brushing, and
     panning.

  -  (20 minutes): open space for questions and interactively solving
     Bokeh problems on your real-life problems & data as time permits.
