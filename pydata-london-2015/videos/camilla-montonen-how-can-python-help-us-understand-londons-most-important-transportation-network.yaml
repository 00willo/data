summary: |
  If you work in London, you have certainly experienced the joys and
  frustrations of commuting on the Tube. There are the very good mornings
  (lo and behold! An empty seat on the Northern Line) and then there are
  the very bad mornings (there is more space in a sardine can than on the
  Piccadilly). Using graph-tool, Bokeh and SimPy, we unravel some of the
  fascinating features of the London Tube.

  The daily commute in London is an adventure that keeps surprising, in
  good ways and in bad. Some mornings things go smoothly: for once there
  is an empty seat on the Northern Line and you only need to wait ten
  minutes before reaching the escalator at Bank. On other days, a signal
  failure at Moorgate and all Piccadilly line travellers will become
  intimately acquainted with the sweet fragrance of a fellow commuter's
  toothpaste. After a few months, the more or less frustrated commuter
  will begin to notice some interesting patterns and ask questions. Why is
  it that a suspended Circle line can wreak havoc on commuters on the
  Central line? Can delays at Victoria lead to overcrowding of the Jubilee
  platform at London Bridge? What is the fastest way to visit all stations
  in the Tube network?

  The London Tube can be modelled as a graph with vertices representing
  the stations and edges representing the connecting Tube lines. Using
  intuition and daily experience, we can guess that there are certain
  vertices in the Tube network that are vital to the overall health of the
  network. Pythonic graph analysis libraries such as graph-tool and
  interactive visualizations with Bokeh can corroborate that suspending
  stations â€“ for example Baker Street, which lies at the intersection of 5
  Tube lines- can cause congestion even at remote stations throughout the
  network.

  In addition to studying the static properties of the London Tube, we
  will leverage the power of SimPy to create various simulations. This
  will allow us to explore how the Tube network evolves when key
  parameters such as commuter numbers, train speeds and the frequency of
  signal failures are introduced on and off peak times.

  This talk is aimed at novice Python users. The attendees will hopefully
  come away with a basic understanding of how to use the graph-tool
  library to create graphs and store meta-information about them, how to
  use Bokeh to stream information to an interactive browser visualization
  and how to use SimPy to create simple simulations. While it will not be
  technically challenging, it will hopefully inspire beginner Pythonistas
  to seek interesting problems and apply libraries in the Python data
  analysis ecosystem to pose questions about data and then figure out the
  answers!
