summary: |-
  A discussion and tutorial of how to use pymc to predict rugby
  results. Also will include an introduction to Bayesian statistics.

  Probabilistic Programming and Bayesian Methods are called by some a
  new paradigm. There are numerous interesting applications such as to
  Quantitative Finance.I'll discuss what probabilistic programming is,
  why should you care and how to use PyMC and PyMC3 from Python to
  implement these methods. I'll be applying these methods to studying
  the problem of 'rugby sports analytics' particularly how to model the
  winning team in the recent Six Nations in Rugby. I will discuss the
  framework and how I was able to quickly and easily produce an
  innovative and powerful model as a non-expert.

  Using Pymc and the pydata stack to attack a problem in rugby analytics.
  Similar to my talk submitted to Berlin. Probabilistic Programming and
  Bayesian Methods are called by some a new paradigm. There are numerous
  interesting applications such as to Quantitative Finance. I'll discuss
  what probabilistic programming is, why should you care and how to use
  PyMC and PyMC3 from Python to implement these methods. I'll be applying
  these methods to studying the problem of 'rugby sports analytics'
  particularly how to model the winning team in the recent Six Nations in
  Rugby. I will discuss the framework and how I was able to quickly and
  easily produce an innovative and powerful model as a non- expert. I will
  go into more detail than normal, giving a few examples of Bayesian
  Programming, and a brief introduction to statistics and statistical
  thinking. My technical case study will be the Rugby Analytics, Football
  Analytics and FinTech friendly Quantitative Finance examples. Technology
  used: PyMC, PyMC3, Pandas, Pydata stack. I recommend Anaconda installed
  on your laptops to get everyone off the ground easily. Link to the
  Tutorial is here `PyMC
  Tutorial <https://github.com/springcoil/TutorialPyMCRugby>`__ I have the
  following dependencies for my tutorial. pip install patsy pandas pip
  install pymc - PyMC2 pip install git+https://github.com/pymc-devs/pymc3
  - PyMC3 pip install seaborn
