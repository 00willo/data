summary: |-
  Recent advances in combining structured graph data with textual data
  using embedding word representations from a large corpus of
  unlabelled data. This allows to expand the knowledge base graph and
  extract complex semantic relationships.

  Targeting knowledge graphs completion is a recent paradigm that allow
  extraction of new relations (facts) from existing knowledge graphs like
  Freebase or GeneOntology. Word embeddings represents each entity into a
  low dimensional space and the relationships as vectorial transformations
  which has the advantage of making the search space continuous. This
  allows to encode the entities and transformations with global
  information from the entire graph. On the other hand, word embedding
  approaches, like word2vec, extracted from unlabeled text allows
  representations of words as vectors, although it doesn't allow to
  extract relationships . By careful alignment of entities from free text
  with a knowledge graph it is possible to combine both approaches and
  jointly extract new knowledge through relationships between entities and
  words / phrases. We will show results from applying this technology to
  biomedical data.
