  IPython was born as an Interactive Python shell on steroids 14 years ago, but its notebook tool is shaping the way scientists, developers and even journalists communicate and explore science. After its rebirth as the Jupyter project, we will examine its importance and future in Open Science and scientific publishing now that Nature highlighted its awesome features!

  This talk is both a shortened version of the recent history of the
  Jupyter project (previously IPython) and a case for reproducibility in
  science. We will glance at the recent milestones of the project, address
  some common myths still heard in business environments regarding open
  source, show the possibilities of Jupyter as an environment for several
  different languages (specially Julia and R) and talk about possible
  future developments.
