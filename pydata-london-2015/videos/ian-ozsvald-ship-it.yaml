  Building and shipping working data science products is hard - learn from
  10 years of Ian's experience to find efficient ways through the mess of
  bad data, difficult team communication and poorly maintained code
  through to successfully deployed projects. The talk will include ways of
  getting data, cleaning and debugging it, approaches to deployment and
  various tips I've picked up along the way that'll save you time. If you
  frequently start new projects or you're involved in deploying working
  systems then this talk should have something for you.
