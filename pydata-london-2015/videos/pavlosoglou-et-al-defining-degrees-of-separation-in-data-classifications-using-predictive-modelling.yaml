summary: |-
  A talk about techniques to classify what data we share and with whom.
  In the corporate and government world, there is a plethora of
  security models that determines who has access to what and who knows
  about it. In this presentation, we define the novel concept of
  degrees of separation in data classification security models and use
  machine learning techniques to infer non public data.

  We all use techniques to classify what data we share and with whom. In
  this presentation we look at a novel of combining the aggregate public
  data available to retrieve non public information about users. We define
  the way to infer private data with a certain probability from public
  data as a degree of separation on that data.

  We use machine learning techniques to first do feature extraction from
  this combined public data and utilise predictive models to infer non
  public data. We present an analysis starting with public twitter feeds
  from data scientists and then define three degrees of separation for
  that data.

  In conclusion, we show a model that combines the heuristics of feature
  selection with the security model of data classification to define the
  degrees of separation.
