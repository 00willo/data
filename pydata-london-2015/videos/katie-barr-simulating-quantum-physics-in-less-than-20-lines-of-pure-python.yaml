  Quantum physics is notoriously tricky, but if you have some coding
  ability, exploring quantum systems is extremely easy. The discrete time
  quantum walk is the quantum analogue of the classical random walk, and
  was developed in the hope of it having algorithmic applications. In
  fact, the model is universal for quantum computation, and famous
  algorithms such as Grovers' (quantum search) can be described in terms
  of it.

  I will describe the code for a quantum walk on a 2d lattice, and
  indicate how this code can be used and adapted to address open research
  questions in the field of quantum information.

  As well as describing in detail how to simulate quantum walks, I will
  give a brief introduction in general to simulating quantum systems, the
  sorts of things you look for if investigating them numerically, and the
  suitability in general of using simulation as a tool for researching
  physics. After making it look ridiculously easy, I will describe the
  challenges faced by people investigating quantum systems numerically,
  and other reasons why we need quantum computers.
