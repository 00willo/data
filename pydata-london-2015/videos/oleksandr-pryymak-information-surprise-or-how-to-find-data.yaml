  What is our curiosity? How can we measure and model surprise of discovery? Philosophical questions, which have been pondered from different angles, also found definitions in Bayesian framework. I'll touch basics, review ideas, and illustrate on Twitter data how entropic measures can be efficiently used to detect events and summarise them.

  What is our curiosity? How can we measure and model surprise of
  discovery? Philosophical questions, which have been pondered from
  different angles, also found definitions in Bayesian framework. I'll
  review our understanding of surprise, touch theoretical basics, and
  finally illustrate on Twitter data how we can detect events and cherry
  pick most representative data points relying on entropic measures.
