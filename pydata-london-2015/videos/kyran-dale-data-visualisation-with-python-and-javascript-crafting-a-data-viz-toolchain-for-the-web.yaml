  To accompany an upcoming O'Reilly book 'Data-visualisation with Python
  and Javascript: crafting a dataviz toolchain for the web' (see
  `here <http://kyrandale.com/blog/data-visualization-python-javascript/>`__)
  this talk aims to sketch out the toolchain by transforming some dry
  Wikipedia data (Nobel prize-winners) into a far more engaging and
  insightful web- visualisation. This transformative cycle uses Python
  big-hitters such as Scrapy, Pandas and Flask, the latter delivering data
  to Javascript's D3. These are the industrial lathes of the toolchain but
  Python's fantastic standard library and all those first class
  data-munging libraries are involved, the spanners, hammers and
  screwdrivers of the toolchain.

  While Python is fast becoming the goto language for
  data-processing/science, the visual fruits of that labour hit the wall
  of the web, where there is only one first-class language, Javascript. To
  develop a data-viz toolchain for the modern world, where
  web-presentation is increasingly mandated, making Python and Javascript
  play nicely is fundamental. This talk aims to show that the perceived
  wall between the two languages is actually a thin, permeable membrane
  and that, with a bare minimum of web-dev, one can get on with
  programming seamlessly in both.
