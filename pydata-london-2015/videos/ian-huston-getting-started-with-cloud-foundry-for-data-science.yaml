  will learn how to push an application to a real CF instance, how to
  connect to managed data services like Redis and PostgreSQL and how to

  `Cloud Foundry <http://cloudfoundry.org/>`__ is an open source
  Platform-as-a- Service that can be used to easily deliver data driven
  applications. In this tutorial we will learn how to push an application
  to a real CF instance, how to connect to managed data services like
  Redis and PostgreSQL and how to deploy PyData and R projects using
  community buildpacks.

  By the end of the tutorial participants will know how to \_ deploy your
  first app using Cloud Foundry, \_ connect to databases and other data
  services, \_ use PyData packages with a Heroku-style buildpack, \_ find
  public and private Cloud Foundry installation options.

  Participants will need to register on a public Cloud Foundry instance to
  follow along with the tutorial. Detailed instructions will be provided
  for `Pivotal Web Services <http://run.pivotal.io/>`__ which offers a 60
  day free trial. Other options include IBM Bluemix and HP Helion
  Development Platform.

  Participants should be comfortable on the command line and download and
  install the `CF CLI
  tools <http://docs.cloudfoundry.org/devguide/installcf/install-go-cli.html>`__
  before the tutorial.
