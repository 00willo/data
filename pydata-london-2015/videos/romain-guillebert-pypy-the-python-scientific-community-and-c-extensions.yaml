  Recently we've seen the rise of new technologies like Julia, those have
  the ability to build a new ecosystem on a clean slate and thus be better
  than Python in some aspects. What would it take to be as good as those
  technologies on those aspects without loosing all the things we love
  about Python? This talk will describe my perfect future where Python
  keeps getting better, gets to keep it's great set of libraries, where
  PyPy fits in that future and why C extensions are a big road block.
