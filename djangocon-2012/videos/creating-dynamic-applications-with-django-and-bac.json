The ORM, form processing, the admin interface, and wealth of\ncommunity applications make Django the right tool for a number of situations.\n\nOne thing that Django doesn\u2019t do well is make it terribly easy to create\nhighly-interactive, dynamic interfaces. There are solutions that people are\nworking on. This talk will be about using Django with Backbone.js to help\ncreate these interfaces. Backbone.js is a Javascript framework that, in many\nways, sees the world in the same way as Django. These two tools can complement\neach other nicely.\n\nTopics:\n\n  * Similarities and differences in how the two frameworks see the world\n  * Creating REST interfaces with Django REST Framework\n  * Tools to ease the interface between Django and Backbone\n  * Templating strategies\n  * Shortcomings and implications on accessibility\n\n", "video_mp4_url": null, "tags": ["django"], "copyright_text": "Creative Commons Attribution license (reuse allowed", "related_urls": [], "video_flv_download_only": false, "source_url": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Is0TIzSG3eg", "video_webm_url": null, "video_ogv_length": null, "video_ogv_url": null, "language": "English", "video_webm_length": null, "summary": "See how well Django and Backbone.js can complement each other, and learn a few\nbest-practices for building dynamic web applications using these tools in\nconcert.\n\n", "thumbnail_url": "http://i.ytimg.com/vi/Is0TIzSG3eg/hqdefault.jpg", "video_flv_url": null}
