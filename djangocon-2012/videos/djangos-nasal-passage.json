  "summary": "Django's testrunner gets you started quickly, but you soon hit your head\non its limitations as your project grows. By trading it for nose, a\ntesting framework popular in the wider Python community, we can reduce\nboilerplate, boost performance, and improve testing UI, with only a few\nlines of setting changes. Re-use your test DBs, integrate with Jenkins,\nsplit your suite into pieces, and more.\n",
  "description": "-  Why nose?\n\n   -  Pain points with standard Django testing\n   -  Extensibility without writing custom, uncombineable testrunner\n      subclasses\n   -  Rich ecosystem of helpful plugins\n\n-  django-nose\n\n   -  Testing just your apps, not all the random installed stuff\n   -  Test-selection tricks: running just failed tests, running a\n      module, etc.\n   -  Killing the boilerplate:\n   -  No more imports into **init**\n   -  No more class name collisions and accidental shadowing\n   -  With all this freedom, how best should you organize your tests?\n   -  Going 4 times faster with fixture bundling\n   -  Troubleshooting\n   -  Fixtures are evil\n   -  Where do I put the factories?\n   -  Speeding startup with test DB reuse\n   -  Writing faster TransactionTestCases with hygienic base classes\n   -  Background on Django's handling of TransactionTestCases\n   -  How to improve matters\n   -  Test-only models: what's the best practice?\n\n-  nose-progressive\n\n   -  Dots considered harmful. When will my tests be done?\n   -  Patience is for the dead. Show me my tracebacks as they happen!\n   -  My terminal is only this big. Don't waste my space.\n   -  Hiding pointless stack frames\n   -  Editor round-tripping for quick debugging\n\n-  Splitting into sub-suites\n\n   -  An introduction to the attr plugin\n   -  Have some run only on CI machines, some constantly, others before\n      checkin\n   -  Choosing tests with regexes\n\n-  Other fun plugins\n\n   -  f7u12, for when your tests get angry\n   -  Coverage\n   -  xunit, for your continual integration pleasure\n   -  Profiling\n\n\n",
