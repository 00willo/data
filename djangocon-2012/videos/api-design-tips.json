  "summary": "The focus of this talk will be on some pragmatic tips on how to design\nprogrammatic (non-web-based) APIs for use by other developers.\n",
  "description": "If you're a developer of any sort (Django, Python, Javascript, etc),\nchances are that someone, at some point, will have to take the code\nyou've written & use it in a different context. This is even more\namplified if you work on OSS, where people *will* use it in ways you've\nnever dreamed about.\n\nThis talk is a reflection on my experience building libraries for other\npeople's consumption & thoughts on how to design/make (non-HTTP) APIs in\na way that will make others love you (or at least not hunt you down &\nstrangle you).\n",
