Now what? I'll go over\npackaging your application to add to the Python Package Index (PyPi), creating\ndocumentation to host on Read The Docs and setup an environment to test your\napplication against different versions of Python and Django. I'll also go over\nsome things you should and shouldn't do when maintaining your app over the\nyears.\n\n## Packaging\n\n  * Creating a setup.py\n  * Registering your package\n  * Uploading your package\n  * Sane versioning with PEP386\n\n## Documentation\n\n  * Getting started with Sphinx\n  * Using Read the Docs\n\n## Testing\n\n  * Running your app tests\n  * Testing multiple Python/Django versions with tox\n  * Testing your documentation build\n\n## Things to Do\n\n  * State your goals\n  * Let others help you\n  * Include a license\n  * Prepare for the future\n\n## Things to Avoid\n\n  * Rejecting every contribution\n  * Accepting every contribution\n  * Developer burnout\n\n## Conclusion\n\nReusable applications are my favorite feature of Django. It does take work to\nmaintain an open source app but it can be quite rewarding. If you use these\ntools you can help provide your users with the best experience and empower\nthem to help you with your application.\n\n", "video_mp4_url": null, "tags": ["django"], "copyright_text": "Creative Commons Attribution license (reuse allowed", "related_urls": [], "video_flv_download_only": false, "source_url": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgWFTrXn0_U", "video_webm_url": null, "video_ogv_length": null, "video_ogv_url": null, "language": "English", "video_webm_length": null, "summary": "Django has a thriving community of open source pluggable applications.\nMaintaining an external application can be a rewarding experience and doesn't\nneed to take over your life.
