The vast majority of Python code written in 2014 is still a ``SyntaxError`` on the latest version of Python. Some people have been wondering: will Python 3 ever take off? \r\n\r\nWe have done some data mining from PyPI to reveal what progress the community has made so far toward migrating the long tail of packages towards Python 3 and which packages are most critical in the dependency graph of unported packages. We extrapolate from current growth rates about when (if ever) Python 3 support will reach a tipping point after which more new code will be written in Python 3 than Python 2.\r\n\r\nWe then share our perspective on mistakes made in the Python 3 transition and lessons that we can all learn from. The lessons apply to migrating any interface -- a language, a codebase, or a web API.", "video_mp4_url": "", "tags": [], "copyright_text": "http://www.youtube.com/t/terms", "related_urls": [], "video_flv_download_only": false, "source_url": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tEcZ8eDKAc", "video_webm_url": "", "video_ogv_length": null, "video_ogv_url": "http://mirror.linux.org.au/pub/pycon-au/pyconau2014/50-out.ogv", "language": "English", "video_webm_length": null, "summary": "", "thumbnail_url": "http://i.ytimg.com/vi/7tEcZ8eDKAc/hqdefault.jpg", "video_flv_url": ""}
