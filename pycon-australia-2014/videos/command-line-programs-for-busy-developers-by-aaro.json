In addition to the\r\nPython standard library's getopt, optparse and argparse there is a bewildering\r\narray of packages available on the Python Packaging Index. Packages like Click,\r\nCliff, Docopt, Invoke all provide different mechanics for creating command line\r\napplications. When all you want to do is expose a command line and get back to\r\ncreating functionality, it\u2019s hard to know which alternative to reach for.\r\n\r\nThis presentation will have two parts, the first half will be a brief survey\r\nof popular modules. Strengths, weaknesses and design philosophies will be\r\ncompared by creating command line processing for the same example program.\r\n\r\nThe second half will go into more depth on a specific package, Begins. This\r\npackage was authored by the presenter to minimise the disruption developers\r\nexperience when breaking flow to implement command line processing. The\r\naudience will be shown how a single line of code can create a complex command\r\nline interface. It will also be shown how a handful of decorators from the\r\nBegins API can eliminate boilerplate code and create powerful, complex\r\napplications.", "video_mp4_url": "", "tags": [], "copyright_text": "http://www.youtube.com/t/terms", "related_urls": [], "video_flv_download_only": false, "source_url": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5l4JNt2ozI", "video_webm_url": "", "video_ogv_length": null, "video_ogv_url": "http://mirror.linux.org.au/pub/pycon-au/pyconau2014/57-out.ogv", "language": "English", "video_webm_length": null, "summary": "", "thumbnail_url": "http://i.ytimg.com/vi/D5l4JNt2ozI/hqdefault.jpg", "video_flv_url": ""}
