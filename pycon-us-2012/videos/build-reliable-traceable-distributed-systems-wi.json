  "summary": "We will show how to build simple yet powerful RPC code with ZeroMQ, with\nvery few (if any!) modification to existing code. We will build fan-in\nand fan-out topologies with ZeroMQ special socket types to implement\nPUB/SUB patterns and scale up job-processing tasks. Thanks to\nintrospection, the resulting services will be self-documented. Finally,\nwe will show how to implement distributed tracing.\n",
