  "summary": "This talk traces lightweight concurrency from Python 2.2's generators,\nwhich enabled semi-coroutines as a mechanism for scheduling \"weightless\"\nthreads; to PEP 342, which created true coroutines, and hence made\nevent-driven programming easier; to 3rd party libraries built around\ncoroutines, from older GTasklet and peak.events to the current\nGreenlet/gevent and Twisted Reactor.\n",
