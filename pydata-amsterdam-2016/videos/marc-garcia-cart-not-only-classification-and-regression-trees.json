  "description": "PyData Amsterdam 2016\n\nDescription\n\nDecision trees are very simple methods compared to Support Vector Machines, or Deep Learning. But they have some interesting properties that make them unique. For classification, for regression, or to extract probabilities, decision trees are easy to set up, and debug. And they are excellent to get a better understanding of your data.\n\nAbstract\n\nThis talk will cover Decision Trees, from theory, to their implementation in Python.\n\nThe talk will have a very practical approach, using examples and real cases to illustrate how to use decision trees, what we can expect from using them, and what kind of problems we will need to address.\n\nThe main topics covered will include:\n\nWhat are decision trees?\nHow decision trees are trained?\nData preprocessing for decision trees\nUnderstanding your data better with decision tree visualization\nDebugging decision trees using common sense and prior domain knowledge\nAvoiding overfitting, without cross-validation\nPython implementation\nPerformance",
