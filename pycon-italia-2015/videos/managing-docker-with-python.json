Docker is a valid alternative to the traditional virtual machines and it is redefining the IT service deployment.\r\n\r\nThanks to the available Docker APIs, we have witnessed a remarkable proliferation of tools based on the same APIs to efficiently manage virtual infrastructures: a place of honor, among of all of these, is reserved to the libraries and tools written in Python.\r\n\r\nThis talk is divided into two parts:\r\n\r\n* The first part provides an introduction to Docker by illustrating a typical use case: a network of micro-services aimed to manage a web application.\r\n\r\n* The second part goes into detail on how to write Python code which will be able to orchestrate Docker images and containers.\r\n", "video_mp4_url": "", "tags": [], "copyright_text": "", "related_urls": [], "video_flv_download_only": false, "source_url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ph4Ou4SNlw", "video_webm_url": "", "video_ogv_length": null, "video_ogv_url": "", "language": "Italian", "video_webm_length": null, "summary": "This talk gives an overview about the Python modules that allow you to interact with Docker.", "thumbnail_url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/5ph4Ou4SNlw/maxresdefault.jpg", "video_flv_url": ""}
