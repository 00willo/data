  "description": "Machine learning is an amazing research and application field, which\nperfectly matches math skills with coding abilities in order to define\nprograms that are able to learn from data. Therefore, after having\ndefined our own (mathematical) model, machine learning is about writing\ncode - sometimes a lot of - to actually make the model to work. However,\none point usually underestimated or omitted when dealing with machine\nlearning algorithms is how to write good quality code.\n\nTest-driven development (TDD) is one of the most popular agile methods,\nspecifically designed to support developers in producing (potential)\nless-buggy code by writing tests before the actual code under test. The\napplication of test-first programming principles to the implementation\nof Naive Bayes classifiers or Neural networks looks like a daunting\nchallenge.\n\nConversely, the test-code-refactor cycle strategy founds its principles\nin the scientific method: make a proposition of validity, share results,\nwork in feedback loops. Moreover, this kind of approach to tackle\nproblems, in this particular case would also allow for a better\nunderstanding of how the whole learning model works under the hood.\n\nIn this talk, examples of Test-Driven implementations of some of the\nmost famous machine learning algorithms will be presented using\nscikit-learn.\n\nThe talk is intended for an intermediate audience. The content of the\ntalk is intended to be mostly practical, and code oriented. Thus a good\nproficiency with the Python language is required. Conversely, no prior\nknowledge about TDD nor Machine Learning algorithms is necessary to\nattend this talk.\n",
