The solutions proposed by the developers of MPI and the new languages in this space are all addressing the problem the way it's always been addressed. What I present is a way to attack the massively parallel problem that reduces the complexity of MPI programming to that of implementing a very simple state machine. I've used this combination of MPI and IoC to write state-of-the-art applications that run on some of the largest supercomputers around the world.", "video_mp4_url": "", "tags": [], "copyright_text": "CC BY-SA", "related_urls": [], "video_flv_download_only": false, "source_url": "http://youtu.be/h4gYrAuKgqM", "video_webm_url": null, "video_ogv_length": null, "video_ogv_url": null, "language": "English", "video_webm_length": null, "summary": "", "thumbnail_url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/h4gYrAuKgqM/hqdefault.jpg", "video_flv_url": null}
