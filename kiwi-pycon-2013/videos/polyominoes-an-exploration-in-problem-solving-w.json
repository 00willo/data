  "description": "@ Kiwi PyCon 2013 - Saturday, 07 Sep 2013 - Track 2\n\n**Audience level**\n\nIntermediate\n\n**Abstract**\n\nA \"Polyomino\" is a geometric figure of adjacent squares. But just how\nmany \"n\" polyominos are there?\n\nThis question has been one of our favourite interview questions. It's a\ndeceptively simple problem with opportunities for innovative solutions\nand disastrous missteps. In this talk, we'll discuss the benefits of a\nnumber of approaches, demonstrate a few common pitfalls and challenge\nthe audience to provide their own solutions, with prizes on offer at the\nend of the conference.\n\nThis is a talk for everyone: beginners will be introduced to a problem\nthat can be solved using primitives, experts will see opportunities to\ndeploy advanced optimizations.\n\n**Slides**\n\nhttps://speakerdeck.com/nzpug/hamish-campbell-polyominoes-an-exploration-in-problem-solving-with-python\n",
