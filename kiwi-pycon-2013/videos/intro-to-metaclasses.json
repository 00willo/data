  "description": "@ Kiwi PyCon 2013 - Saturday, 07 Sep 2013 - Track 2\n\n**Audience level**\n\nIntermediate\n\n**Abstract**\n\nPython's Metaclasses are an \"advanced\" technique, but once you get\nstarted they're surprisingly approachable.\n\nStarting with the basics, we'll:\n\n-  figure out what a metaclass does\n-  point out some existing metaclasses you might already have used\n-  see where you might use one in your own code.\n\nWe'll compare use of a metaclass with some alternatives that don't use\nmetaclasses, to better understand why you'd want to use them.\n\nThen we'll take a look at a couple of use-cases where using a metaclass\nhelps us achieve a much more friendly and intuitive API than we\notherwise could.\n\n**Slides**\n\nhttps://speakerdeck.com/nzpug/craig-de-stigter-intro-to-metaclasses\n",
