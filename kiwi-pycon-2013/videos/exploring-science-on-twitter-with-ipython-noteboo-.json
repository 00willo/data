My initial dataset is 13.5 million tweets I collected during 2011. Since the start of 2012 I've been using Python for my data analysis.\r\n\r\nI'll demonstrate how I've been using IPython notebook [1] with the Pandas [2] data analysis library to work with large data tables and time series data. The IPython notebook is a great tool for research, allowing notes about research to be kept interleaved with the python code. The ability to quickly see results and plot them using Matplotlib [3] encourages interactive exploration of the data.\r\n\r\n[1] http://ipython.org/notebook.html\r\n[2] http://pandas.pydata.org/\r\n[3] http://matplotlib.org/\r\n\r\n**Slides**\r\n\r\nhttps://speakerdeck.com/nzpug/brenda-moon-exploring-science-on-twitter-with-ipython-notebook-and-python-pandas", "video_mp4_url": "", "tags": [], "copyright_text": "", "related_urls": [], "video_flv_download_only": false, "source_url": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FzCk747yjCU", "video_webm_url": "", "video_ogv_length": null, "video_ogv_url": "", "language": "English", "video_webm_length": null, "summary": "Exploring discussions of 'science' on Twitter by analysing 13.5 million tweets from 2011.
