  "summary": "I dictate my code using a voice recognition system with Python embedded\nin it. In a fast paced live demo, I will code a small system and deploy\nit without touching the keyboard. I hope to convince you that voice\nrecognition is no longer a crutch for the disabled or limited to plain\nprose.\n",
  "description": "Two years ago I developed a case of Emacs Pinkie (RSI) so severe my\nhands went numb and I could no longer type or work. Desperate, I tried\nvoice recognition. At first programming with it was painfully slow but,\nas I couldn\u2019t type, I persevered. After several months of vocab tweaking\nand duct-tape coding in Python and Emacs Lisp, I had a system that\nenabled me to code faster and more efficiently by voice than I ever had\nby hand.\n\nIn a fast-paced live demo, I will create a small system using Python,\nplus a few other languages for good measure, and deploy it without\ntouching the keyboard. The demo gods will make a scheduled appearance. I\nhope to convince you that voice recognition is no longer a crutch for\nthe disabled or limited to plain prose. It\u2019s now a highly effective tool\nthat could benefit all programmers.\n",
