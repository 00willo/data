  "summary": "Why do pianos sound different from guitars? How can we visualize how\ndeafness affects a child's speech? These are signal processing\nquestions, traditionally tackled only by upper-level engineering\nstudents with MATLAB and differential equations; we're going to do it\nwith algebra and basic Python skills. Based on a signal processing class\nfor audiology graduate students, taught by a deaf musician.\n",
