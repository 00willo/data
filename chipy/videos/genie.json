  "summary": "This talk will introduce Genie, a new programming language with a\nPython- inspired syntax that compiles into binary executables and\nlibraries. Behind the scenes, Genie is a dialect of Vala, and a full\nparticipant in the GObject universe. I will cover the language basics,\nwith an eye to comparing them with Python, and guide you around some\npotential pitfalls. This is the second in a series of talks I am giving\non the topic of Python/GObject integration.\n",
