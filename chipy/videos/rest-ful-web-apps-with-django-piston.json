  "summary": "A common complaint about Django, the leading Python web application\nframework, is that it doesn't make writing REST APIs easy enough. In\nfact the paradigm for a typical Django application involves views which\nmap to HTML page templates. With end users increasingly expecting rich\ninterfaces with the responsiveness of a desktop application, this\nparadigm is being superseded. Fortunately a third-party Django\napplication called Piston fills the gap. Django/Piston can be combined\nwith the Ext JS JavaScript framework and widget set to create\nattractive, responsive Web applications, and this talk will show you\nhow.\n",
