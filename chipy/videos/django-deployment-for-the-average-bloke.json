  "description": "This is the config you want to use if you don't know what you want to\nuse. You don't need to make any choices, you don't have to do any\nresearch, and you don't even need to read the docs if you don't want to.\nAnd as an added bonus, I show how to wget a vm image to deploy into with\nnetwork ports exposed. It is very much like working with a hosting\nprovider like Slice Host, and it makes a great framework for testing\nserver installs.\n",
