Reflecting on these ideas is valuable when you build a new one, but also when you simply use an existing web framework.\r\n\r\nIn this talk I will discuss the slow genesis of Morepath, a micro web-framework with super powers that I've created, and discuss some of the ideas behind it, things I've learned, and also share some thoughts about the creative process.\r\n\r\nThe ideas behind Morepath are not revolutionary, but hopefully still make you think.\r\n", "thumbnail_url": "http://i1.ytimg.com/vi/9A5T9C2OBB4/hqdefault.jpg", "video_flv_url": ""}
