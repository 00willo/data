The\nCommon Language Runtime is very different to CPython, with a powerful JIT\ncompiler, and different garbage collection and threading model. More\nimportantly, .NET's huge range of libraries can now be used from Python.\nVarious aspects of developing with IronPython will be covered and attendees\nwill put this into practice by extending an example application. Topics\ninclude: Differences between IronPython and CPython, including \"Why Use\nIronPython?\" Introduction to the .NET framework - a dynamic language on a\nstatically typed framework GUIs with Windows Forms Databases Network requests\nand web services Handling XML Threading Come with laptop - running Linux,\nWindows or Mac OS X - and ready to code!\n\n  \n[VIDEO HAS ISSUES: first 5 min muted ]\n\n", "video_mp4_url": "http://05d2db1380b6504cc981-8cbed8cf7e3a131cd8f1c3e383d10041.r93.cf2.rackcdn.com/pycon-us-2009/219_pycon-2009-application-developing-with-ironpython-part-2-of-3.mp4", "tags": ["ironpython", "pycon", "pycon2009"], "copyright_text": "Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 3.0", "related_urls": [], "video_flv_download_only": false, "source_url": "", "video_webm_url": null, "video_ogv_length": null, "video_ogv_url": null, "language": "English", "video_webm_length": null, "summary": "", "thumbnail_url": "http://a.images.blip.tv/Pycon-DevelopingWithIronPythonPart002699-446.jpg", "video_flv_url": null}
