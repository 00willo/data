  "description": "Welcome to A Tour of Python Standard Library. Together let us explore\nthe various modules, which will help you to build robust working\nprograms. Once you know about a particular library well, you will start\nreplacing those 20 odd lines of code you used to write with a 2-3 lines\nand feel safe that your code will now work on all the platforms that\nPython supports. Just like the galaxy, the Python Standard Library is\nvast and when hitch-hiking I will take you through some important ones\nthat happen to be used most often. You can explore, ask questions,\nexperiment through out the ride. Welcome! And let the journey begin.\n",
