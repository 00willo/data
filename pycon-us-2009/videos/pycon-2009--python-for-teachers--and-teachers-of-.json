In taking this tutorial, you're\nopening a communications channel between yourself, and other eager learners\nhoping to partake more deeply of open source culture and the opportunities it\noffers. We know from last year that many PyCon delegates are broadly\ninterested in education track. This proposal attempts to support this demand\nby developing some publicly-accessible Python-related material that\ndemonstrates how object-oriented programming be learned by using them to\nimplement concepts from the mathematical domain. Learning can take place at\nmultiple levels: Python and object-oriented concepts. Mathematical concepts,\nwhich will be demonstrated in ways readily accessible to anyone who\nunderstands Python. Presentation of programming topics in the educational\nenvironment. From this latter point of view the pair teaching format can be\nconsidered experimental. Its success or otherwise will be determined largely\nby group dynamics, and our goal is to make the outcome in and of itself\nprovide useful empirical data helpful to others planning workshops.\n\n", "video_mp4_url": "http://05d2db1380b6504cc981-8cbed8cf7e3a131cd8f1c3e383d10041.r93.cf2.rackcdn.com/pycon-us-2009/201_pycon-2009-python-for-teachers-and-teachers-of-teachers-part-1-of-2.mp4", "tags": ["pycon", "pycon2009", "teaching"], "copyright_text": "Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 3.0", "related_urls": [], "video_flv_download_only": false, "source_url": "", "video_webm_url": null, "video_ogv_length": null, "video_ogv_url": null, "language": "English", "video_webm_length": null, "summary": "", "thumbnail_url": "http://a.images.blip.tv/Pycon-PythonForTeachersAndTeachersOfTeachersPart001339-797.jpg", "video_flv_url": null}
