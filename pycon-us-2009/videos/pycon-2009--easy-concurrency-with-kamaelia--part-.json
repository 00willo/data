  "description": "[VIDEO HAS ISSUES: ] Writing concurrent applications in Python is now\nbecoming not only easier, but quite elegant and simple, thanks to\nKamaelia. Kamaelia is an interesting component based framework\noriginating from BBC research. It accomplishes concurrent processing of\ndata from and to many protocols. Components easily connect and pass data\nfrom and to each other. We are going to explore Kamaelia's strengths and\npossibilities, by running simple examples, then trying nested protocol\nsupport, and maybe some other fun examples if time permits.\n",
