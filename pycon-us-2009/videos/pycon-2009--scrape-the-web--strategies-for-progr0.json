  "description": "[VIDEO HAS ISSUES: Speaker walked away from the mic most of the time.]\nDo you find yourself faced with websites that have data you need to\nextract? Would your life be simpler if you could programmatically input\ndata into web applications, even those tuned to resist interaction by\nbots? We'll discuss the basics of web scraping, and then dive into the\ndetails of different methods and where they are most applicable. You'll\nleave with an understanding of when to apply different tools, and learn\nabout a \"heavy hammer\" for screen scraping that I picked up at a project\nfor the Electronic Frontier Foundation. Atendees should bring a laptop,\nif possible, to try the examples we discuss and optionally take notes.\n",
