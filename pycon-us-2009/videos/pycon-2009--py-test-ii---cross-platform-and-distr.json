  "description": "py.test II - cross-platform and distributed testing (part 2 of 3)\n\nWant to know more about advanced automated testing with Python? Use a\ntool that allows you to ad-hoc distribute tests to multiple CPUs for\nspeed and to multiple platforms for compatibility checks? With tons of\ndebugging help in failure situations? This tutorial provides in-depth\ninformation on advanced usages of the popular py.test tool. We highlight\nits current feature set including using and writing extensions for\ngenerating HTML pages, testing Javascript or ReST documents. We showcase\nand discuss ways of distributing tests across CPUs and platforms and\nwill leave time to discuss and tackle specific scenarios brought up\nduring the session. The tutorial format will be an interactive lecture\nwith plenty of time for questions.\n\n[VIDEO HAS ISSUES: ]\n",
