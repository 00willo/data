  "description": "This talk will go through the ups and downs of a machine learning beginner trying to create a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) to implement a music generating algorithm. We will build off of Gabe's PyGotham 2016 talk (The Sounds Of Data: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vb9c_WFMYeI) and will attempt to implement an RNN based on Alex Graves\u2019 Generating Sequences With Recurrent Neural Networks (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1308.0850.pdf).\nGabe Levine is a [musician](http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12049-migration/) turned [software engineer](https://github.com/gabelev), and Jonathan Arfa is a [Statistics and  Machine Learning enthusiast](https://github.com/jarfa)",
