  "description": "Data analysis is a complex process with frequent shifts among data formats, tools and models, as well as between symbolic and visual thinking. How might the design of improved tools accelerate people's exploration and understanding of data? Covering both interactive demos and principles from academic research, my talk will examine how to craft a careful balance of interactive and automated methods, combining concepts from data visualization, machine learning, and computer systems to design novel interactive analysis tools.\n\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R.\n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases.",
