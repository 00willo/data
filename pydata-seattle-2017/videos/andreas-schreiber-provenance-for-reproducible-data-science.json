  "description": "In science, results that are not reproducible by peer scientists are valueless and of no significance. Good practices for reproducible science are to publish used codes under Open Source licenses, perform code reviews, save the computational environments with containers (e.g., Docker), use open data formats, use a data management system, and record the provenance of all actions.\n\nThe provenance of data provides detailed information about the origin of that data. That includes information about ownership and both actions and modifications performed on the data. With provenance information, data will be traceable and users can be confident in quality of the data. To specify and store provenance information, W3C has standardized the provenance model PROV. Using PROV and associated implementations, users can record provenance of data analytics processes. The provenance information are directed acyclic graphs that can be analysed to get insight into the data analytics processes.\n\nThe talk covers * Introduction to provenance and PROV * Modelling provenance for data processing * Python APIs for provenance recording * Provenance recording for Jupyter notebooks * Storing provenance in graph databases * Analysis of provenance information\n\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R.\n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases.",
