How could a Data Scientist integrate Spark into their existing Data Science toolset? How does Python work with Spark? How could one leverage the rich 10000+ packages on CRAN for R?\n\nWe will start with PySpark, beginning with a quick walkthrough of data preparation practices and an introduction to Spark MLLib Pipeline Model. We will also discuss how to integrate native Python packages with Spark.\n\nCompare to PySpark, SparkR is a new language binding for Apache Spark and it is designed to be familiar to native R users. In this talk we will walkthrough many examples how several new features in Apache Spark 2.x will enable scalable machine learning on Big Data. In addition to talking about the R interface to the ML Pipeline model, we will explore how SparkR support running user code on large scale data in a distributed manner, and give examples on how that could be used to work with your favorite R packages.\n\nPresentation: https://www.slideshare.net/felixcss/scalable-data-science-in-python-and-r-on-apache-spark\n\nwww.pydata.org\n\nPyData is an educational program of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States. PyData provides a forum for the international community of users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. The global PyData network promotes discussion of best practices, new approaches, and emerging technologies for data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData communities approach data science using many languages, including (but not limited to) Python, Julia, and R.\n\nPyData conferences aim to be accessible and community-driven, with novice to advanced level presentations. PyData tutorials and talks bring attendees the latest project features along with cutting-edge use cases.",
