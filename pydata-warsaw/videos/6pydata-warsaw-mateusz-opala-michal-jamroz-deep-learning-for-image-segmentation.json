  "description": "Deep learning techniques ignited a great progress in many computer vision tasks like image classification, object detection, and segmentation. Almost every month a new method is published that achieves state-of-the-art result on some common benchmark dataset. In addition to that, DL is being applied to new problems in CV.\n\nIn the talk we\u2019re going to focus on DL application to image segmentation task. We want to show the practical importance of this task for the fashion industry by presenting our case study with results achieved with various attempts and methods.",
