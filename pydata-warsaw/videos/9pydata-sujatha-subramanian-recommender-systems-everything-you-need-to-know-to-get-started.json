  "description": "We are in the era of hyper personalization where relevant information finds you. Recommender systems are an integral part of making this happen. In this presentation we will discuss about various approaches of Recommender systems. We start with basic models like \"Content-based filtering\", \"Collaborative filtering\" and move to advanced implementations that use Stochastic Gradient Descent to do \"Matrix factorization\" and \"Restricted Boltzmann Machine\" using Deep Learning with Tensorflow",
