  "description": "Documentation Driven Development\n\nPresented by Corey Oordt\n\nDevelopers usually leave documentation as a final step; one that they\nwill get to as soon as they are forced with threats of bodily harm.\nWriting the documentation before writing the code, can lead to better\ncode, better implementation and, of course, actual documentation.\n\nAbstract\n\n\"Documentation Driven Design\" was coined by our team after noticing how\ndocumenting code dramatically changed how we approached problems. By\nwriting the documentation first, you saw the problem from a different\nperspective: the end user or programmer. This talk will focus on a few\nitems:\n\nUsable, not just functional. Many times developers write code that\nsolves the problem, but is a real pain in the neck to use. Writing the\ndocumentation first demonstrates how easy or difficult it is to\nimplement the solution right away.\n\nA guide to what to write. Many developers leave documentation undone\nbecause they don't know how to approach it. Having some idea of what\nneeds writing can make the task seem less daunting.\n",
