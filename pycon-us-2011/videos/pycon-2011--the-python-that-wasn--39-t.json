Only the most essential changes make it--and for every change that\ngets accepted, many more are rejected. Come learn about proposed changes to\nthe Python language that failed--what, how, and why.\n\nAbstract\n\n  * Quick overview of the process \n    * First ten years: send GvR a patch \n    * The modern approach: python-ideas, write a PEP, produce a reference implementation \n  * Discuss the \"prickly\" Python community \n    * This is a good thing! Only the best ideas survive the python-dev gauntlet! \n    * They do this not because they're mean, but because they care so much. \n    * We must have eternal vigilance to prevent unnecessary changes! \n  * A survey of some changes that didn't make it \n    * The switch/case statement (PEP 3103) \n    * The \"freeze protocol\" (PEP 351) \n    * The \"dynamic attribute access\" proposal from python-dev, 2007/02 \n    * Many more possibilities await in the rejected PEPs! \n  * My message to the audience \n    * Start with a post to python-ideas, please! \n    * Don't be surprised if you get a negative reaction \n    * Don't let your fear of a negative reaction stop you from trying, necessarily \n    * Do your homework, and be your own worst critic \n\n", "video_mp4_url": "http://05d2db1380b6504cc981-8cbed8cf7e3a131cd8f1c3e383d10041.r93.cf2.rackcdn.com/pycon-us-2011/406_the-python-that-wasn-t.mp4", "tags": ["coredev", "cpython", "makingsausage", "pycon", "pycon2011"], "copyright_text": "Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 3.0", "related_urls": [], "video_flv_download_only": false, "source_url": "", "video_webm_url": null, "video_ogv_length": 132000761, "video_ogv_url": null, "language": "English", "video_webm_length": null, "summary": "", "thumbnail_url": "http://a.images.blip.tv/Pycon-PyCon2011ThePythonThatWasnt367.png", "video_flv_url": null}
