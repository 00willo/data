We will discuss Python 2 and\nPython 3: what the compatibility issues are, what the main differences are,\nand also talk about migration, Python 2.6/2.7, and other transition tools.\n\nAbstract\n\nPython is currently at a crossroads: Python 2 has taken it from a quiet word-\nof-mouth language to primetime, with many companies around the world using it\nand an ever-increasing global marketshare of the programming world. But now\ncomes Python 3, the first version of the language that is not backwards\ncompatible with previous releases.\n\nWhat does this mean? Are all my Python programs going to break? Will I have to\nrewrite everything? How much time do I have? When is Python 2 going to be\nEOL'd? Is the language undergoing a complete rewrite and will I even recognize\nit? What are the changes between Python 2 and 3 anyway? Also, the next\ngeneration is already here, as Python 3 is over two years old now. What has\nbeen ported so far, and what is its current status? Are migration plans or\ntransition tools available? If I want to start learning Python, should I do\nPython 2 or Python 3? Are all Python 2 books obsolete?\n\nWe will attempt to answer all of these questions and more.
