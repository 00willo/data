Through the use of\npublic APIs, Django Packages constantly fetches hard data from PyPI, Github,\nand Bitbucket, aproviding a powerful mash-up of real-world data on the volume\nof usage of a particular package. At a glance you can see which package is the\nmost downloaded, which is the most used, and which has seen ongoing\ndevelopment.\n\nThe project is open sourced on Github, with all non-user data accessible\navailable via the API. Django Packages was conceived and and launched in the\n2010 Django Dash. Since launch it has seen features added incrementally and\nwas a frequently mentioned project at the 2010 DjangoCon and was #1 on Hacker\nNews on Sunday, December 5, 2010. It's purpose is to provide a place for\nDjango Developers to submit, research, and review apps, projects, and\nframeworks.\n\nThe talk will cover:\n\n  * Launching the project \n    * The pre-Django Packages state of finding Django apps \n    * Grids, not tags \n    * Only hard metrics allowed, no opinions or rating systems! \n    * Slurping content from PyPI, Github, Bitbucket, Launchpad, SourceForge, and Google Project Hosting \n    * Lessons Learned AKA The Zen of Python and PEP-8 \n    * Deployment and backups \n  * The Month after launch \n    * New feature considerations \n    * Handing over the keys to reduce bus factor \n    * Excitement when seeing it being used as a reference \n  * DjangoCon \n    * Sprint tactics for your pet project \n    * Development of an API \n    * Github, Google Project Hosting, and PyPI \n  * Going forward \n    * Planned new features for Django Packages \n    * Forking Django Packages to save the world \n    * pypackages.com - a forthcoming place to review Python applications, frameworks, and packages \n\n", "video_mp4_url": "http://05d2db1380b6504cc981-8cbed8cf7e3a131cd8f1c3e383d10041.r93.cf2.rackcdn.com/pycon-us-2011/448_django-packages-a-case-study.mp4", "tags": ["packages", "pycon", "pycon2011"], "copyright_text": "Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 3.0", "related_urls": [], "video_flv_download_only": false, "source_url": "", "video_webm_url": null, "video_ogv_length": 161676965, "video_ogv_url": null, "language": "English", "video_webm_length": null, "summary": "", "thumbnail_url": "http://a.images.blip.tv/Pycon-PyCon2011DjangoPackagesACaseStudy119.png", "video_flv_url": null}
