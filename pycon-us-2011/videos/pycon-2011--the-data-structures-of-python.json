Do\nyou know about all the cool data structures hidden in the standard library?\nThis talk will be a review of the characteristics of the different data\nstructures, and a tour of idiomatic ways to use some of the structures in the\nstandard library.\n\nAbstract\n\nFirst, as a note this talk borders between survey and discuss in depth. For\neach data structure I want to cover their implementation, performance\ncharacteristics, and idiomatic usage (e.g. tuples vs. lists), a lot of them\nhave similar implementations so idiomatic usage will dominate for some of\nthem.\n\n  * The builtins (10 minutes) \n    * lists \n      * Ordered collections of any type of objects \n      * Mutable \n      * Implemented as an array of pointers \n    * tuples \n      * Ordered collections of any type of objects \n      * Immutable* \n      * Implemented as a fixed-length array of pointers \n    * dicts \n      * Unordered mapping of hashable objects to any objects \n      * Mutable \n        * Why no immutable variant\n      * Implemented as an open-addressed hash table. \n    * sets \n      * Unordered collection of hashable objects \n      * Mutable \n        * frozenset\n      * Implemented as an open-addressed hash table. \n  * The Standard Library (10 minutes) \n    * OrderedDict \n      * Ordered mapping of hashable objects to any objects \n      * Mutable \n      * Implemented as a dict with a doubly-linked list running through it. \n    * deque \n      * Ordered collection of any type of objects \n      * Mutable \n      * Implemented as an unrolled, doubly-linked list \n    * namedtuple \n      * Ordered collection of any type of objects, *also* addressable by name. \n      * Immutable \n      * Implemented as a tuple with extra properties \n    * array \n      * Like a list... but limited to \"primitve\" types. \n  * Performance characteristics. \n  * Writing your own (5 minutes) \n    * Abstract Base Classes \n      * Duck typing \n        * Why would you want to use them!\n      * What's available. \n    * OrderedSet \n      * An ordered collection of hashable objects \n      * Mutable \n      * Implemented as a set with a doubly-linked list running through it. \n  * Questions (5 minutes) \n\n", "video_mp4_url": "http://05d2db1380b6504cc981-8cbed8cf7e3a131cd8f1c3e383d10041.r93.cf2.rackcdn.com/pycon-us-2011/420_the-data-structures-of-python.m4v", "tags": ["abc", "datastructures", "dequearray", "dict", "ducktyping", "frozenset", "list", "namedtuple", "ordereddict", "orderedset", "pycon", "pycon2011", "set", "tuple"], "copyright_text": "Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 3.0", "related_urls": [], "video_flv_download_only": false, "source_url": "", "video_webm_url": null, "video_ogv_length": 161075055, "video_ogv_url": "http://05d2db1380b6504cc981-8cbed8cf7e3a131cd8f1c3e383d10041.r93.cf2.rackcdn.com/pycon-us-2011/420_the-data-structures-of-python.ogv", "language": "English", "video_webm_length": null, "summary": "", "thumbnail_url": "http://a.images.blip.tv/Pycon-PyCon2011TheDataStructuresOfPython246.png", "video_flv_url": null}
