  Have you ever worked on embedded project? Chances are that you had to
  use some proprietary IDE for development. Wouldn't it be better to
  use some open source IDE like Eclipse or QtCreator? What should I do
  when I'm working a project and can't start from the scratch?

  In this presentation I'll show you how Python can help you with
  porting projects. I'll give examples of projects developed in IAR
  Embedded Workbench and Keil uVision. At the end we'll have CMake
  build file which can be imported to many IDEs.

  Python modules like Objectify and Jinja will be a great help to us!
