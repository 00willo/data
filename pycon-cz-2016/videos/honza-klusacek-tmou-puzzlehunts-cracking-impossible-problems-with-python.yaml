  Do you like codes, riddles and ciphers? Some people have turned
  cracking puzzles into a hobby and gave rise to events dedicated to
  solving such problems – puzzlehunts. TMOU is the oldest and biggest
  one among them. During these games, players regularly feel the
  frustration from endless unsuccessful efforts, often quickly followed
  by extraordinary joy after finally figuring out the peculiar problem.
  This joy can only be surpassed by creating a perfect puzzle for
  others to solve.

  I will share a few lessons learnt while organizing TMOU, namely:

  - What makes a problem seemingly impossible
  - How to turn impossible into possible and hard into not-so-hard
  - How to crack tough problems and hammer down their complexity
  - Why Python might be a good hammer for that

  Follow the creation of a specific puzzle from an initial idea to the
  final design (puzzle #4 "the Dice", TMOU 17
  http://www.tmou.cz/2015/sifry/reseni#kostka). Where else would you
  need to solve a bunch of problems just to create a new one?
