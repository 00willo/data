  The world is not perfect and network failures do happen. Complaining
  about instability might not always be enough. Especially when your
  system depends on multiple networked services and each of them is on
  a critical path to the final result.

  In this talk we will recall why network failures happen. Reason what
  we can and cannot handle in the code. And see what Python standard
  libraries and a few popular ones such as urllib3 and requests can
  offer.

  And that's not all. Network Emulation (netem) module of Linux Traffic
  Control (tc) can even help with poor network simulation.

  Now there is no excuse.
