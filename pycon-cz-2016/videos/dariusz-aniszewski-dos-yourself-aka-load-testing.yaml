  In my talk I'd like to tell you about testing performance of your
  backend applications. I'll explain what load testing is in theory and
  how to do it in practise. I'd like to focus on why load testing is
  important step in software development and what will most likely
  happen when it's forgotten. I'll walk through different tools that
  can be used, starting with very basic AB, via jMeter up to the Locust
  and cloud-based services.
