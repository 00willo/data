  Agile software development used to be really cool back in the 00's.
  The vision of old school waterfall projects, with months of work
  before integrating and releasing software to users gives me the
  creeps. But let's return to the present. I can hardly even recall
  working in a non-agile project. I feel that most of the Agile
  manifesto principles are in my DNA more than a thing to follow. If
  you want to keep growing in this industry you might want to start
  building on top of that. This presentation contains my experience
  about aligning people, sharing a direction, and how servant
  leadership works.
