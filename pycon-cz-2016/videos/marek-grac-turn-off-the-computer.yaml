  Fence agents are drivers written in Python that help you to remove a
  misbehaving computer node from cluster or cloud. This project started
  in 2006 and it was written in bash/perl/C. And after 5000+ commits we
  have a Python/C project. What happened in the last ten years? And how
  maintainable is such project?
