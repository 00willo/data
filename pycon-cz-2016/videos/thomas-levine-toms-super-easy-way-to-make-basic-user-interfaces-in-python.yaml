  Horetu (https://pythonhosted.org/horetu) exposes Python functions as
  command-line interfaces, web interfaces, and configuration files. In
  addition to being a very practical tool, horetu is interesting
  because its implementation demonstrates the capabilities of function
  objects. Finally, horetu can construct powerful interfaces and
  detailed documentation from functions that were written with no
  intent of being used with horetu; it is, consequently, a clear
  demonstration of the merits of following conventions.
