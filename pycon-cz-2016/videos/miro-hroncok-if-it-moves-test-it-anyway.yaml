  If it Moves, Test it Anyway

  Now you write tests and you want them to be part of the project, run on your CI etc., but:

  * the API is secured by a secret token/password/cookie...
  * the information on the webpage changes
  * it's not even accessible from the wild web

  So how do you test it? You can mock the server part (that's messy),
  you can spin off your own testing server (that's hard) or you can
  record the HTTP communication with betamax (that's super simple).
  I'll show you all the methods and their good, bad and ugly parts.
