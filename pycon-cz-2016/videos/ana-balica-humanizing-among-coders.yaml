  What makes a good developer? Certainly technical expertise,
  insightfulness, creativity, thoughtfulness. What about daily social
  interactions with other developers inside the company and community?
  Those are never easy. Even though we all try to be nice to each
  other, sometimes unintentionally we can be a bit off. I'd like to
  share with you some stories that helped me rationalize some of my own
  communication and human interaction mistakes and how I'm trying to
  correct them.
