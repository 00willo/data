  My team and I have been building a Python 3 stock trading platform
  for the past 2.5 years. We are powering a trading fund that runs a
  range of manual and automated strategies. This is a story of what we
  have learned about Asyncio, profiling, optimization, debugging, and
  operations... in a fast-moving environment where bugs actually cost
  money.
