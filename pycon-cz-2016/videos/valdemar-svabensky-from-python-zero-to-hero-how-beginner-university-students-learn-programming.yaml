  Are you curious about how to teach programming effectively? Are you a
  Python fan interested in everything Python-related? Or would you
  simply like to see a non-standard presentation? If you answered yes
  at least once, then this funny and inspiring talk is right for you!
  In less than 20 minutes, you'll hear from a young student-teacher
  about:

  - What coding skills are taught to beginners and how
  - Experience with teaching
  - A few surprises

  No technical knowledge is needed (some code samples will be shown,
  but they're not essential). Discussion at the end is welcome. Looking
  forward to seeing you!
