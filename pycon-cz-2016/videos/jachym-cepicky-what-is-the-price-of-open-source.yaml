  We keep hearing, that "open source if for free, so why don't you use
  it?" But is that really true? What are the real costs of open source
  software? Where does the money come from? How do the developers make
  their living? Is it really as free as a beer? How to bring money to
  open source software development? Is open source the one and only
  greatest and only good and best possible development model?
