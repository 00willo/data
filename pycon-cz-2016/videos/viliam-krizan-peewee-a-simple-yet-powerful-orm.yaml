  Peewee is a small, expressive ORM, written as a single Python module.
  In my talk, I will present usage examples including advanced queries,
  transactions, and backend switching. We will look at differences
  between Peewee and SQLAlchemy, see how Peewee takes advantage of
  operators to build SELECT queries, learn how to integrate Peewee into
  a Flask-based application, and cover the most common difficulties
  when trying to extend Peewee.
