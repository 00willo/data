  Demistifying GIL - what's that, how it really affects performance,
  what changed in the last few years and what can we do about GIL in
  everyday programming.

  There is still a lot of misunderstanding regarding GIL, coming from
  not-so-perfect documentation - not explaining the implications
  thoroughly and in a simple way; it's also often outdated.

  Also, GIL's implementation changed a little in CPython 3.x that may
  affect programmers' choices.

  This misinformation may, in some cases, drive them away from CPython
  where it's not really the worst choice. By providing comprehensive
  guide to today's GIL in CPython, this presentation aims to help make
  better design choices - be it choosing a concurrency/parallelism
  model, Python implementation to use or even whether or not to drop
  Python entirely.

  There have been (and still are), of course, attempts to get rid of
  GIL and find another solution for the problem it solves - newest of
  which is Larry Hasting's project called GILectomy, which I hope to
  shed some light on.
