  Open-sourced and inner-sourced projects often struggle to get
  engagement. Communities, such as Github and PyPi, are host to
  redundant projects and libraries. In the development space, how do
  you distinguish your project from others, get people excited to
  contribute to it, and ultimately create a successful open source
  project? The answer is to apply user-centered design techniques to
  the development of your project. User-centered design is usually
  applied to web applications and products on the front-end of a
  website, but these techniques can be applied to open source
  libraries. In user-centered open source projects, your users are
  those who type `pip install $your_library`. In this talk, Jackie will
  illustrate some user-centered techniques that have been used on her
  own project - Mesa (https://github.com/projectmesa/mesa), along with
  other successful open source projects.
