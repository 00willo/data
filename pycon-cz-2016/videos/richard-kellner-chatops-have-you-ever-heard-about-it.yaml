  ChatOps is a term for a collaborative way of running DevOps,
  including operating aspects of systems and infrastructure through an
  online chat. It combines a powerful way to get things done with a
  more human way of working.

  But it doesn’t happen overnight. In this talk I would like to explain
  various stages of adoption. I also want to inspire you to implement
  ChatOps into your workflow and to suggest ideas how to do that. I
  will show you why Python is the ideal language for building a ChatOps
  stack. It is quick and fun to build new chat commands and even a
  person who doesn’t know Python can easily start learning and see the
  results immediately.
