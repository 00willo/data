  Become a data wrangler with Python! This talk will introduce you to
  the core concepts of data analysis with Python. We’ll cover libraries
  that allow you to easily clean and set up your initial dataset,
  importing data from all different file types and standards. We’ll
  introduce some basic libraries to help with statistics and analysis
  and then cover how to document and explore your findings.

  It’s assumed you have a working understanding of Python and its data
  types and structures, and that you’ve used and understand Python for
  basic scripting. It’s also assumed you haven’t done much in terms of
  data analysis, and you’d like to learn more. If this is you, welcome!
