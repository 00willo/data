  I have been involved with Fedora Community Operations Team from its
  conception one year ago. Amongst other things we at CommOps are
  trying to build tools to understand the community and make it more
  contributor-friendly. While newcomer onboarding is important for any
  FOSS community, retaining them is critical. We have been working on
  improving the contributor retention rates in Fedora Community for a
  while now. In this direction, we have built some Python-based scripts
  to understand the activity of Fedora contributors and their life
  cycles. We have also tried to analyze contribution activity of some
  successful contributors and find common patterns in their behavior
  and have tried to measure the impact of attending FOSS events on the
  activity of a contributor and on the Fedora community as a whole. All
  this work has been done using Python and during this talk, I want to
  share details about the tools we have built, how we built them and
  the insights we have generated from them.
