  This talk will introduce the audience to the Dask library for data
  analysis, focusing on when Dask is useful (and when you might be
  better off simply using SQL or Pandas). We will cover how to build
  and analyze directed acyclic graphs using Dask and how to easily set
  up a cluster running Dask for your data wrangling needs.
