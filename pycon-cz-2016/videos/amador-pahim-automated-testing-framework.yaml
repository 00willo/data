  Avocado is a next generation testing framework inspired by Autotest
  and modern development tools such as git. One can call it a test
  framework with benefits. Native tests are written in Python and they
  follow the unit test pattern, but any executable can serve as a test.

  In this presentation we will cover the Avocado architecture, main
  features, demonstrations and we will also compare Avocado with some
  known test runners.
