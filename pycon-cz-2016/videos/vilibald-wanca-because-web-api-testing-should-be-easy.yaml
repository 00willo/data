  Web APIs are often called REST APIs, which recently became a part of
  the everyday life of many Python developers. Sure, it can be a blast
  to build an API with frameworks like Django or Flask, but writing
  tests for it can be a tedious drag: asserting every single HTTP code,
  set of headers, JSON responses, error states… you know the drill.
  Despite all that you do, you still need to assure your API clients
  won’t be exposed to any unexpected surprises. At Apiary, we've
  developed an Open Source testing framework called Dredd, which has
  baked in first-class Python support. It does all the heavy lifting
  and boring stuff for you while allowing you to alter the test cases
  with arbitrary Python code.

  Let Judge Dredd do your API justice.
