  Have you always wondered where the batteries from Python: batteries
  included are? Despair no more! We come with battery-powered Python
  devices for your daily life.

  We will focus on showcasing and live demonstration of Python running
  on very small microprocessors.

  First, an overview of existing platforms which can run Python on
  batteries. Then we will showcase in a live demo what Python can do
  for you. Finally a “how to” workflow for successful Python coding on
  low power ARM Cortex microprocessors will be revealed to get you
  started.
