  "description": "What if you could rethink the Python web framework? What would it be like?\u00a0\n\nA few years ago, I had the opportunity to do this. The result is a web framework called Morepath. It doesn't look wildly different on the outside. I'm going to demonstrate a few ways in which it is different.\u00a0\n\nIf you're a user of a web framework, I want to show you use cases you may not even realize you have.\u00a0If you're a developer of a web framework, I want to offer you ideas you may not have considered.",
