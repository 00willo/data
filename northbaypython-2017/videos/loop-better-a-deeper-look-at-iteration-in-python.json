Do you know how to create infinitely long iterables?\r\n Come to this talk to learn some of Python's slightly more advanced looping techniques.\r\n\r\nIterables are a very big deal in Python and they became even more important in Python 3.  There's quite a bit beyond the basics when it comes to loops and looping in Python.  Let's learn some of Python's slightly more advanced looping techniques!\r\n\r\nIn this session, we'll take a step back and learn about how looping actually works in Python.  We'll then learn about a number of Python looping techniques that you've probably overlooked.\r\n\r\nWe'll learn about the difference between sequences, iterables, and iterators.  We'll also reveal the iterator protocol that powers `for` loops in Python.\r\n\r\nAfter we learn the basics, we'll learn some techniques for working with infinite infinite iterables, generators, and generator expressions.\r\n\r\nAttendees will walk away from this session with specific actionable recommendations for refactoring their own code as well as a wealth of new topics to look deeper into after the session.\n\nAbout North Bay Python\r\n\r\nA single-track conference north of the Golden Gate, focused on community, collaboration, and all things Python.\r\n\r\nNorth Bay Python is a two-day, single-track Python conference held at the Mystic Theatre in Historic Downtown Petaluma, California, over the weekend of December 2 & 3, 2017.\r\n\r\nWe're a nonprofit conference for professionals, enthusiasts and students alike. We're focused on inclusion, accessibility, diversity, and affordability. Most importantly, we're planning a great lineup of talks from all over the Python ecosystem, with plenty of time to meet new people and develop new ideas.\r\n\r\nOur venue, the Mystic Theatre in Downtown Petaluma, is a beautiful example of an early 1900s Vaudeville theatre. You can find over 50 different food and drink options a short walk away, and the nearest hotel is only a block away.\n\nA Python conference north of the Golden Gate\r\n\r\n\r\nNorth Bay Python is a single-track conference with a carefully curated set of talks representing the diverse Python community and their different areas of interest.\r\n\r\nIf a topic is less to your interest, or you've met some people you really want to sit down and chat with, we'll have plenty of areas away from the main theatre to catch up and chat.\r\n\r\nOur goal is to keep prices as low as possible. That means we won't be catering lunch. Instead, you can look forward to extra-long lunch breaks you can use to explore all of the great food options around the venue.",
