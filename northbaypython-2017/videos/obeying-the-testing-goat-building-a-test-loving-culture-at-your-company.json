  "description": "Julia Duimovich\n\nhttps://2017.northbaypython.org/schedule/presentation/7/\n\nWe all know we should test our code. We all know that we should have a hypothetically perfectly tested codebase. But how many people actually do? Why don't we? What's stopping us? We'll talk about the skills and mentality everyone needs to have, the infrastructure that cuts down on the amount of work that you need to do to write a test, directly influencing how many of your coworkers actually write comprehensive tests. We'll also talk about planning and the torturous process of accepting what you can't test. You'll leave this talk planning to add an onboarding session dedicated to testing, excited about test infrastructure such as factories, and looking forward to the day that you discover the tests are there, and they can help you understand the code's structure and intended usage.\n\nAbout North Bay Python\r\n\r\nA single-track conference north of the Golden Gate, focused on community, collaboration, and all things Python.\r\n\r\nNorth Bay Python is a two-day, single-track Python conference held at the Mystic Theatre in Historic Downtown Petaluma, California, over the weekend of December 2 & 3, 2017.\r\n\r\nWe're a nonprofit conference for professionals, enthusiasts and students alike. We're focused on inclusion, accessibility, diversity, and affordability. Most importantly, we're planning a great lineup of talks from all over the Python ecosystem, with plenty of time to meet new people and develop new ideas.\r\n\r\nOur venue, the Mystic Theatre in Downtown Petaluma, is a beautiful example of an early 1900s Vaudeville theatre. You can find over 50 different food and drink options a short walk away, and the nearest hotel is only a block away.\n\nA Python conference north of the Golden Gate\r\n\r\n\r\nNorth Bay Python is a single-track conference with a carefully curated set of talks representing the diverse Python community and their different areas of interest.\r\n\r\nIf a topic is less to your interest, or you've met some people you really want to sit down and chat with, we'll have plenty of areas away from the main theatre to catch up and chat.\r\n\r\nOur goal is to keep prices as low as possible. That means we won't be catering lunch. Instead, you can look forward to extra-long lunch breaks you can use to explore all of the great food options around the venue.",
