  "description": "Henry Tanner\n\nhttps://2017.northbaypython.org/schedule/presentation/11/\n\nAs your python project grows and the number of contributors increases, the stability,  readability and usability of your code-base can diminish. The once expressive experience of a single author writing dynamically typed Python can turn into a real headache as the complexity of your system develops.\r\n\r\nBut Python can still be a great choice for large applications - the library\u2019s for scientific applications and web API\u2019s are well documented, open-source and have been in development for decades. Mypy is a tool that (pretty much) allows you to have your cake and eat it. By combining the convenience and maturity of Python with a powerful type system and compile-time checking, you can make your project incredibly easy to read, debug and test for all contributors.\r\n\r\nMy talk will summarise the main features of Mypy and will also give you a head start on how to convert (and maintain) an existing code-base to include static annotations.\n\nAbout North Bay Python\r\n\r\nA single-track conference north of the Golden Gate, focused on community, collaboration, and all things Python.\r\n\r\nNorth Bay Python is a two-day, single-track Python conference held at the Mystic Theatre in Historic Downtown Petaluma, California, over the weekend of December 2 & 3, 2017.\r\n\r\nWe're a nonprofit conference for professionals, enthusiasts and students alike. We're focused on inclusion, accessibility, diversity, and affordability. Most importantly, we're planning a great lineup of talks from all over the Python ecosystem, with plenty of time to meet new people and develop new ideas.\r\n\r\nOur venue, the Mystic Theatre in Downtown Petaluma, is a beautiful example of an early 1900s Vaudeville theatre. You can find over 50 different food and drink options a short walk away, and the nearest hotel is only a block away.\n\nA Python conference north of the Golden Gate\r\n\r\n\r\nNorth Bay Python is a single-track conference with a carefully curated set of talks representing the diverse Python community and their different areas of interest.\r\n\r\nIf a topic is less to your interest, or you've met some people you really want to sit down and chat with, we'll have plenty of areas away from the main theatre to catch up and chat.\r\n\r\nOur goal is to keep prices as low as possible. That means we won't be catering lunch. Instead, you can look forward to extra-long lunch breaks you can use to explore all of the great food options around the venue.",
