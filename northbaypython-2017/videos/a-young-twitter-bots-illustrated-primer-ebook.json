  "description": "Benno Rice\n\nhttps://2017.northbaypython.org/schedule/presentation/4/\n\nI run a Twitter bot that's aimed to be amusing. It generates tweets based off a mixture of other Twitter feeds, Facebook posts and some other sources. One of the challenges in making this work has been getting decently amusing output.\r\n\r\nThis presentation will go through some of the options available, ranging from simple Markov systems using markovify, through more complicated Markov approaches and will then look at systems based on torch-rnn and other neural network systems.\r\n\r\nYou'll leave this presentation with a decent overview of the ways you can transform content into new content and the strengths and weaknesses of each.\n\nAbout North Bay Python\r\n\r\nA single-track conference north of the Golden Gate, focused on community, collaboration, and all things Python.\r\n\r\nNorth Bay Python is a two-day, single-track Python conference held at the Mystic Theatre in Historic Downtown Petaluma, California, over the weekend of December 2 & 3, 2017.\r\n\r\nWe're a nonprofit conference for professionals, enthusiasts and students alike. We're focused on inclusion, accessibility, diversity, and affordability. Most importantly, we're planning a great lineup of talks from all over the Python ecosystem, with plenty of time to meet new people and develop new ideas.\r\n\r\nOur venue, the Mystic Theatre in Downtown Petaluma, is a beautiful example of an early 1900s Vaudeville theatre. You can find over 50 different food and drink options a short walk away, and the nearest hotel is only a block away.\n\nA Python conference north of the Golden Gate\r\n\r\n\r\nNorth Bay Python is a single-track conference with a carefully curated set of talks representing the diverse Python community and their different areas of interest.\r\n\r\nIf a topic is less to your interest, or you've met some people you really want to sit down and chat with, we'll have plenty of areas away from the main theatre to catch up and chat.\r\n\r\nOur goal is to keep prices as low as possible. That means we won't be catering lunch. Instead, you can look forward to extra-long lunch breaks you can use to explore all of the great food options around the venue.",
