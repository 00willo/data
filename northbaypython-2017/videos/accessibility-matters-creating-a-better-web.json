This talk is meant to help the entire audience start thinking about accessibility and realize how easy it is to at least put some accessibility into a site (or avoid adding blatantly inaccessible content).\r\n\r\nAccording to the U.S. Census Bureau, around 19% of Americans have a disability, which is a large potential audience for any site. Many companies also fall under accessibility laws they might not even be aware cover their products, with lawsuits becoming more prevalent in recent years, and showing a good faith effort to improve your products\u2019 accessibility can help keep your company out of hot water. Accessible web development also tends to lead to better UX and a happier user base. And, another plus: It will save devs time and frustration when they\u2019re working with the code, since good HTML is enforced.\r\n\r\nThis talk will start with a broad introduction to accessibility, how to break different concerns down into categories for consideration, and touch on the US laws and recent legal outcomes around accessibility. The second part will go through examples of good and bad accessibility and what to look out for, as well as ways to improve accessibility (including \"easy wins\" that they could implement quickly to drastically improve their sites). The final section will include resources for finding accessibility standards and also browser extensions and the like for people to check on their own.\r\n\r\nThe audience will be expected to have working knowledge of the internet, webpages, and using webpages.\n\nAbout North Bay Python\r\n\r\nA single-track conference north of the Golden Gate, focused on community, collaboration, and all things Python.\r\n\r\nNorth Bay Python is a two-day, single-track Python conference held at the Mystic Theatre in Historic Downtown Petaluma, California, over the weekend of December 2 & 3, 2017.\r\n\r\nWe're a nonprofit conference for professionals, enthusiasts and students alike. We're focused on inclusion, accessibility, diversity, and affordability. Most importantly, we're planning a great lineup of talks from all over the Python ecosystem, with plenty of time to meet new people and develop new ideas.\r\n\r\nOur venue, the Mystic Theatre in Downtown Petaluma, is a beautiful example of an early 1900s Vaudeville theatre. You can find over 50 different food and drink options a short walk away, and the nearest hotel is only a block away.\n\nA Python conference north of the Golden Gate\r\n\r\n\r\nNorth Bay Python is a single-track conference with a carefully curated set of talks representing the diverse Python community and their different areas of interest.\r\n\r\nIf a topic is less to your interest, or you've met some people you really want to sit down and chat with, we'll have plenty of areas away from the main theatre to catch up and chat.\r\n\r\nOur goal is to keep prices as low as possible. That means we won't be catering lunch. Instead, you can look forward to extra-long lunch breaks you can use to explore all of the great food options around the venue.",
