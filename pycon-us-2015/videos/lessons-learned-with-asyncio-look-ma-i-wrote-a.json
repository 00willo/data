I'll cover what it's for, how it works and describe how I used it to write a real-world networked application (a distributed hash table).\nWe'll explore the event loop, co-routines, futures and networking with examples from my code.\nThis won't be an exhaustive exposition. Rather, attendees will grasp enough of asyncio to continue with their own studies.\n\n", "video_mp4_url": null, "tags": [], "copyright_text": "creativeCommon", "related_urls": [], "video_flv_download_only": false, "source_url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1eew8BngN7Y", "video_webm_url": null, "video_ogv_length": null, "video_ogv_url": null, "language": "English", "video_webm_length": null, "summary": "", "thumbnail_url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/1eew8BngN7Y/hqdefault.jpg", "video_flv_url": null}
