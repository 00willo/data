  "summary": "One of the advantages of cloud computing is that resources can be\nenabled or disabled dynamically. E. g. is an distributed application\nshort on compute power one can easily add more. But who wants to do that\nby hand? Python is a perfect fit to control the cloud. The talk\nintroduces the package `Boto <https://github.com/boto/boto>`__ which\noffers an easy API to manage most of the Amazon Web Services (AWS) as\nwell as a number of command line tools.\n",

The talk\nintroduces the package Boto which offers an easy API to manage most of\nthe Amazon Web Services (AWS) as well as a number of command line tools.\nFirst some usage examples are shown to introduce the concepts behind\nBoto. For that a few virtual instances with different configurations are\nlaunched, and the use of the storage service S3 is briefly introduced.\nBased on that a scalable continuous integration system controlled by\nBoto is developed to show how easy all the required services can be used\nfrom Python. Most of the examples will be demonstrated during the talk.\nThey should be easily adoptable for similar use cases or serve as an\nstarting point for more different ones.\n",
