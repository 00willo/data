Unfortunately, what starts as a simple script can quickly get out of hand as more features are added and more people start using it!\r\n\r\nThe talk will consist of a tour through various useful libraries and practical code showing how each can be used, and include advice on how to best structure simple and complex command-line tools.\r\n\r\nThings to consider when writing command-line apps:\r\n\r\n* Single-file vs Multiple-file\r\n* Standard library only vs. 3rd party requirements\r\n* Installation - setup.py vs. native packaging\r\n\r\nThe different parts of a command-line program:\r\n\r\n* Option Parsing:\r\n    * Libraries: getopt, optparse, argparse, docopt\r\n    * Sub-commands\r\n* Configuration:\r\n    * Formats: Ini file, JSON, YAML\r\n    * Where should it be stored (cross-platform);\r\n    * Having multiple configuration files, and allowing user config to override global config\r\n* Output:\r\n    * Colour - colorama\r\n    * Formatting output for the user\r\n    * Formatting output for other programs\r\n    * How do you know when your output is being piped to another program?\r\n    * Managing logging and verbosity\r\n* Managing streamed input\r\n* Exit values: What are the conventions?\r\n* Interactive apps - REPL\r\n* Structuring a bunch of programs/commands around a shared codebase.\r\n* Command-line frameworks: clint, compago & cliff\r\n* Testing command-line apps\r\n* Writing command-line tools in Python 3 vs Python 2", "video_mp4_url": "", "tags": [], "copyright_text": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/", "related_urls": [], "video_flv_download_only": false, "source_url": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gR73nLbbgqY", "video_webm_url": "", "video_ogv_length": null, "video_ogv_url": "", "language": "English", "video_webm_length": null, "summary": "Command-Line programs can have a lot to them - usually more than you think, yet often suffer from a lack of thought.\r\n\r\nThis is a tour through how to structure your code, tools in the standard library and some 3rd party libraries.
