Software Transactional Memory (STM) is a current academic research topic.  Put the two together --brew for a couple of years-- and we get a version of PyPy that runs on multiple cores, without the infamous Global Interpreter Lock (GIL).\r\n\r\nThe current research is based on a recent new insight that promises to give really good performance.  The speed of STM is generally measured by two factors: the ability to scale with the number of CPUs, and the amount of overhead when compared with other approaches in a single CPU (in this case, with the regular PyPy with the GIL).  Scaling is not really a problem here, but single-CPU performance is --or used to be. This new approach gives a single-threaded overhead that should be very low, maybe 20%, which would definitely be news for STM systems.  Right now (February 2014) we are still implementing it, so we cannot give final numbers yet, but early results on a small interpreter for a custom language are around 15%.  This looks like a deal-changer for STM.\r\n\r\nIn the talk, I will describe our progress, hopefully along with real numbers and demos.  I will then dive under the hood of PyPy to give an idea about how it works.  I will conclude with a picture of how the future of multi-threaded programming might looks like, for high-level languages like Python.  I will also mention CPython: how hard (or not) it would be to change the CPython source code to use the same approach.", "video_mp4_url": "", "tags": [], "copyright_text": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/", "related_urls": [], "video_flv_download_only": false, "source_url": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMyMEsOi8oY", "video_webm_url": "", "video_ogv_length": null, "video_ogv_url": "", "language": "English", "video_webm_length": null, "summary": "PyPy, the Python implementation written in Python, experimentally supports Transactional Memory (TM).
