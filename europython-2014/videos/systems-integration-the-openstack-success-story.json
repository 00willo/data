At the end of the talk, a set of solutions under development, ideas and improvements to the existing ones will be presented.\r\n\r\nThe presentation is oriented to distributed services, fault-tolerance and replica determinism. It's based on a software completely written in python and running successfully on several production environments.\r\n\r\nThe presentation will be split in 3 main topics:\r\n\r\nDistributed System integration\r\n-----------------------------------\r\n\r\n* What's it ?\r\n* Why is it essential for cloud infrastructures?\r\n* Existing methods and strategies\r\n\r\nOpenStack success story\r\n----------------------------\r\n\r\n* Which methods did OpenStack adopt?\r\n* How / Why do they work?\r\n* What else could be done?\r\n\r\nComing Next\r\n---------------\r\n\r\n* Some issues of existing solutions\r\n* What are we doing to improve that?\r\n* Other solutions coming up", "video_mp4_url": "", "tags": [], "copyright_text": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/", "related_urls": [], "video_flv_download_only": false, "source_url": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYzIOrAkb-A", "video_webm_url": "", "video_ogv_length": null, "video_ogv_url": "", "language": "English", "video_webm_length": null, "summary": "OpenStack is a huge, open-source cloud provider.
