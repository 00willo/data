We show in a practical way how you can add your own estimator following the interfaces of Scikit-Learn. First we give a small introduction to the design of Scikit-Learn and its inner workings. Then we show how easily Scikit-Learn can be extended by creating an own estimator. In order to demonstrate this, we extend Scikit-Learn by the popular and robust Theil-Sen Estimator (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theil%E2%80%93Sen_estimator) that is currently not in Scikit-Learn. We also motivate this estimator by outlining some of its superior properties compared to the ordinary least squares method (LinearRegression in Scikit-Learn).", "video_mp4_url": "", "tags": [], "copyright_text": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/", "related_urls": [], "video_flv_download_only": false, "source_url": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZT9NvTXusDk", "video_webm_url": "", "video_ogv_length": null, "video_ogv_url": "", "language": "English", "video_webm_length": null, "summary": "We show how to write your own robust linear estimator within the Scikit-Learn framework using as an example the Theil-Sen estimator known as \"the most popular nonparametric technique for estimating a linear trend\".", "thumbnail_url": "http://i.ytimg.com/vi/ZT9NvTXusDk/hqdefault.jpg", "video_flv_url": ""}
