  "summary": "With the growing world of web, there are numerous use-cases which\nrequire tasks to be executed in an asynchronous manner and in a\ndistributed fashion. Celery is one of the most robust, scalable,\nextendable and easy-to-implement frameworks available for distributed\ntask processing. While developing applications using Celery, I have had\nconsiderable experience in terms of what design choices one should be\naware of while evaluating an existing system or developing one's own\nsystem from scratch.\n",
