  "summary": "Git: it's all the rage in source control. You may use it, but do you\nunderstand it? A million tutorials on the internet tell you what to\ntype, but not why. Let me show you in pictures what's going on behind\nthe scenes in git.\n\nLearn how to navigate, write, and untangle your commit history. Do more\nthan control your source: make it tell a story. After this talk, git\nwill make sense, and so will your project history.\n",
