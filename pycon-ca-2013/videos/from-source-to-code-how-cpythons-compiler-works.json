  "title": "From Source to Code: How CPython's Compiler Works",
  "alias": "video/2331/from-source-to-code-how-cpythons-compiler-works",
  "summary": "How the heck does CPython take a blob of bytes you call source code and\ncreate another blob of bytes called bytecode which it is able to execute\nto make the magic of Python programs work? This talk's aim is to provide\na conceptual answer to that question. The overall process of tokenizing,\nparsing, creating an AST, and then finally emitting bytecode will be\ncovered.\n\nIf you have no clue what any of those previous words meant, don't worry!\nThis talk will be accessible to people who are not compiler experts.\nWe'll also cover how various parts of the compiler are exposed through\nPython's standard library so you can play with what you learn\nafterwards.\n",
