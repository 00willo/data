  "description": "Making it go faster\n\nPresented by W. Matthew Wilson\n\nAn introduction to profiling python code.\n\nI'll use cProfile, pstats, and RunSnakeRun to find where code is getting\nbogged down in a real-world example. I'll measure the run-time cost with\ntimeit, refactor, and measure it again.\n\nFinally, I'll talk about the limits of python optimization and show how\nto replace python code with C.\n",
