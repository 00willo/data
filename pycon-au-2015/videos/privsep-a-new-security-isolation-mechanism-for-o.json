  "summary": "",
  "description": "OpenStack listens to requests over the network, and (when appropriate)\nperforms operations on the host that require root superpowers. Following\nbest-practice design, most of the code runs as an unprivileged user and\nonly the code that needs additional powers runs as root using a tool\ncalled \"rootwrap\".\n\nThis talk discusses the evolution that led to the current rootwrap\ndesign, why it has proven to be completely inadequate in practice, and\npresents a new \"privsep\" alternative currently being worked on within\nOslo.\n",
