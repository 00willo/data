  "description": "There are several (open source and proprietary) packages available for\nimage processing in neuroscience. However, each package has its own\nstrengths and limitations depending on the purpose of the analysis.\nAfter testing many of them at work, we have found a need to develop our\nown packages (at the Brain Imaging Laboratory, MBC). We will expose a\ncouple of python tools that could be handy for anyone dealing with\nneuroscience (or medical images in general) in their projects. The tools\npresented are for (i.) quick image viewing, (ii.) dicom image sorting\nand de-identifying and (iii.) automatic email notifications to alert\nabout server warnings (e.g., if machine is down, close to full capacity,\nfailing to connect to local image archiving network (PACS), etc..).\nWhile many of these tools could have been written in other programming\nlanguages, we will explain the reasons for choosing python, share a bit\nabout our python learning journey and perform a brief demonstration on\nthe command line.\n",
