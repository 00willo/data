  "description": "RESTful APIs reign supreme! No longer do developers have to put up with\nSOAP and XML-RPC and those bulky, schema laden exchanges. JSON maps\nalmost directly to python and we're flying again!\n\nOver time the chaos of free form JSON representations has subsided and a\nnumber of best practices have appeared such that we now expect certain\npatterns when encountering a new JSON REST API. The next step is to\nstandardize these practices and start offering the predictability and\ncode reuse we lost years ago.\n\nThe talk will provide an overview of current attempts at standardizing\nJSON exchanges such as jsonapi, jsonhome and jsonschema.\n",
