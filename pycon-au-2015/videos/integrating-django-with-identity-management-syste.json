Particular\r\ntechnologies covered will include:\r\n\r\n- FreeIPA: an open-source identity management solution, for defining\r\n  users, groups and authorisation policies\r\n\r\n- mod_auth_gssapi / mod_auth_kerb: Apache modules for Kerberos\r\n  authentication\r\n\r\n- mod_lookup_identity: Apache module to retrieve user information\r\n  from a directory\r\n\r\nThe talk will conclude with discussion about upcoming Kerberos\r\nfeatures, techniques for dealing with multiple authentication\r\nmethods, and progress in making identity management integration\r\neasier for Django developers.\r\n\r\nPeople developing or deploying Django applications in business\r\nenvironments or for large open source projects with centralised\r\nidentity management will get the most out of this talk.", "video_mp4_url": null, "tags": [], "copyright_text": "creativeCommon", "related_urls": [], "video_flv_download_only": false, "source_url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HhcotmeioT8", "video_webm_url": null, "video_ogv_length": null, "video_ogv_url": null, "language": "English", "video_webm_length": null, "summary": "", "thumbnail_url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/HhcotmeioT8/hqdefault.jpg", "video_flv_url": null}
