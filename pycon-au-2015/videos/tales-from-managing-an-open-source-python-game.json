  "description": "Ten years ago, a rag-tag bunch of computer camp leaders decided to\ncreate a game that would teach kids teamwork and strategy, and which the\nkids could feel a part of. In those days, the presenter was a young\ndreamer with time on his hands, and he chose to spearhead the project.\nWas this folly? You be the judge. The game was Trosnoth. It is developed\nin Python, using Pygame and Twisted. In this presentation, Josh will\ntell the story of Trosnoth, and share some of the many lessons, both\nsocial and technical, which he learnt while managing the project. Maybe\nyou\u2019ve considered writing a game in Python. Maybe you\u2019re not sure how\nOpen Source projects really work. Maybe you\u2019re an experienced project\nmanager who wants to laugh at some of the mistakes Josh made. Or maybe\nyou just enjoy hearing Josh tell stories. Whoever you are, there\u2019s bound\nto be something in this presentation for you.\n",
