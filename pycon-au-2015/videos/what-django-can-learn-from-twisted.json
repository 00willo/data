  "description": "Web frameworks like Django are designed around the traditional\nrequest-response cycle \u2014 a request comes in, a response is generated,\nand that is delivered to the client. In the day of \u201csingle page\u201d\napplications, where only sections of the page are updated through\nrequests, doing real-time can be clunky. Twisted, and things that build\noff it, like Django Channels, might be worth thinking about, and this is\nwhat this talk will be about.\n",
