Best-practices allow to automate tasks and achieve high-degree of repeatability and robustness.\r\n\r\nJenkins will be used to implement continuous integration and continuous delivery jobs and pipelines. Packer will create images of disposable systems, being containers and Cloud servers.\r\nAnsible will be used to both create images with Packer, and eventually orchestrate provisioning of systems in staging and production environments in a blue-green fashion.\r\n\r\nDeep knowledge of deployment and workflow allows to continuously refine the process, adapt it to custom requirements, and make it smoother.\r\n\r\nThe following technologies will be presented:\r\n\r\n- Ansible\r\n- Docker on CoreOS cluster\r\n- Git repository\r\n- Jenkins\r\n- Openstack\r\n- Packer\r\n- Vagrant", "video_mp4_url": null, "tags": [], "copyright_text": "creativeCommon", "related_urls": [], "video_flv_download_only": false, "source_url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFPtArm4Wc0", "video_webm_url": null, "video_ogv_length": null, "video_ogv_url": null, "language": "English", "video_webm_length": null, "summary": "", "thumbnail_url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/QFPtArm4Wc0/hqdefault.jpg", "video_flv_url": null}
