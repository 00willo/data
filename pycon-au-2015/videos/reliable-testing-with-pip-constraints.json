I will cover their use, design, and how we're using them in devstack (and thus OpenStack CI) - and how you can (and should) use them in your local projects.\n\n", "video_mp4_url": null, "tags": [], "copyright_text": "creativeCommon", "related_urls": [], "video_flv_download_only": false, "source_url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZ_y_U6rZRM", "video_webm_url": null, "video_ogv_length": null, "video_ogv_url": null, "language": "English", "video_webm_length": null, "summary": "", "thumbnail_url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/aZ_y_U6rZRM/hqdefault.jpg", "video_flv_url": null}
