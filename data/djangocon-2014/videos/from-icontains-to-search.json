  "summary": "By, Honza Kr\u00e1l\nGood search experience for your users is about more than just a more efficient way to find models containing certain word or phrase. In this talk we'll go through what are the relevant parts of search and how to best implement them (we'll use Elasticsearch for actual examples).\n\nThe goal of the talk is to demystify search engines and provide the attendees with the tools required to create a great search experience for their sites. It will cover basics from information retrieval theory as well as practical examples on how to integrate search into their apps.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/FNEn/",
