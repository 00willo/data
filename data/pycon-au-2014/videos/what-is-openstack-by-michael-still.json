  "summary": "",
  "description": "OpenStack is one of the biggest python projects ever, and is hiring\nplenty of interesting python people to work on Open Source, which is\ncool. Yet, many people tell me that they don't really understand what\nOpenStack is. Let's fix that once and for all.\n\n25 minutes isn't a long time, so what I'll provide is an overview of the\nvarious components of OpenStack and how they tie together. We'll cover\nwhat bits might be of interest to your average python hacker, as well as\nthe general problems we're trying to solve. I secretly hope this will\nenthuse people to come and hack on OpenStack, but its also cool if\naudience members walk away from the talk deciding that OpenStack is not\nof interest to them -- so long as they now understand vaguely what\nOpenStack is, then we're cool.\n\nI'll also try and cover how the OpenStack Foundation and code governance\nmodel works, but it might require talking really fast. We shall see!\n",
