  "description": "In an ideal world, you can join on candidate keys, names are never\nmisspelt, people never move house, and I have a pony. I don\u2019t have a\npony. But we do have record linkage.\n\nRecord linkage (also known as data linkage or fuzzy record matching) is\na naive Bayes algorithm which matches data about individuals across\ndatabases or within a single database, by constructing the probabilities\nthat two records apply to the same individual or to different\nindividuals.\n\nIn this talk I will discuss the techniques of record linkage in Python,\nthe usefulness and the limitations of linkage, and the effect that this\ntechnique is having on healthcare research in particular.\n\nHealthcare/epidemiology studies often require data from more than one\nsource, and individuals frequently have multiple interactions with a\ndata set without a unique identifier. The outcomes of these studies are\nonly as good as the record linkage which underlies them, so the ways in\nwhich record linkage is done can have a direct impact on our ability to\nunderstand, prevent and treat serious medical conditions.\n",
