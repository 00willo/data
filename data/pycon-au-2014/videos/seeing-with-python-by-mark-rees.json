  "description": "In 2013 I purchased a Ninja Block (http://ninjablocks.com/) and wanted to add a camera based sensor to it. So began my adventures in computer vision using python. The talk will discuss the various libraries (including PyOpenCV & SimpleCV ) available for python to perform CV tasks like motion detection, object tracking & facial recognition. As my goals for the camera sensor underwent \"feature creep\" the project required it's own dedicated processing power, so a BeagleBone Black & later a Raspberry Pi were purchased and the project became a IoT device. I will also share my experiences with developing python CV solutions ARM based computers. If the demo gods are willing, code examples will be demonstrated.",
