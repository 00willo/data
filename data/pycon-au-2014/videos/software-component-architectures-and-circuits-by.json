  "summary": "",
  "description": "Python Asynchronous Frameworks are plentiful in the Python Community.\nThere is Twisted, gevent, Tornado, asynccore and now with Python 3.4,\nasyncio. circuits is not yet another Asynchronous Framework (although it\ndoes support Async I/O) but a strong well defined Component Architecture\nfor building complex software with changing requirements. If you have\never developed with Zope or Kamaelia you will be familiar with the\n\"Component\" concept. circuits offers a unique perspective on Component\nArchitectures and offers a novel way to design, implement and deploy\ncomplex software.\n",
