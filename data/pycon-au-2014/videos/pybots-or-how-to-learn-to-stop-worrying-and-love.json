  "description": "In this talk, Anna will argue how physical computing \u2014 building\ninteractive systems such as robots that sense and act upon, or respond\nto the physical world \u2014 provides an ideal application space for teaching\nand learning programming concepts and problem solving; that appeals to a\ndiverse audience; and that can provide a positive introduction to the\nworld of open source software and hardware.\n\nDrawing on her experiences teaching introductory programming with\nArduino-based robots, Anna will step through a tutorial demonstrating\nhow to develop a mobile PyBot - a robot programmed using Python and the\nFirmata protocol, and will provide tips to help you or the apprentice\ncoders in your life to take the first steps towards a lifetime of loving\nto code.\n",
