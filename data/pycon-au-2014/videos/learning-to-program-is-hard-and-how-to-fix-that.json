  "description": "There are a lot of hurdles to overcome when learning your first\nprogramming language - What does this error mean? What's the difference\nbetween a for loop and a while loop? How does pass-by-reference\nevaluation work? What are classes? How do I even begin to turn this task\ninto a working program?\n\nPython is widely used as a language for learning to program, and for\ngood reasons, but there are still plenty of ways that students can get\nstuck, both in learning the language, and in learning more abstract\nprogramming concepts.\n\nThis talk will present a number of challenges frequently faced by\nbeginner students in a university course which teaches students Python\nfrom the ground up, and how the course material was redesigned both to\nmake it easier for students to learn, but also to ensure that students\nencountered all of the necessary challenges so that they'd have\nsomething to learn.\n",
