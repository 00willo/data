  "summary": "", 
  "description": "Cython is an optimising static compiler based on Pyrex, created by Greg Ewing from the university of Canterbury.  It bridges the worlds of Python and C, letting you write code that runs close to C speed in a syntax that is very close to Python.  This talk will show how you can speed up a typical Python program with Cython datatypes.  We\u2019ll call C functions directly, passing NumPy arrays with ease.  We\u2019ll see how we can release the global interpreter lock, letting us run multiple threads in parallel near C speeds.  We\u2019ll look at Cython\u2019s parallel module for data parallelism and compare it to some alternatives and discuss the pros and cons.",
