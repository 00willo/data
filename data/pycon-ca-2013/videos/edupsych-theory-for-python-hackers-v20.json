  "title": "EduPsych Theory for Python Hackers v.2.0", 
  "summary": "I've taken two years of graduate courses in pedagogical design, educational psychology, and community development. I save you $50k in tuition and hundreds of hours of reading and give you the short version for Pythonistas who care about education and outreach. You'll learn how to critically analyze and describe your Python learning/teaching methods and progress to other hackers and/or educators. This is a revised and expanded version of a talk given at the last PyCon in Santa Clara, with insights from the current batch at Hacker School.",
