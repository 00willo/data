  "summary": "Controlled experiments, also called randomized experiments and A/B\ntests, have had a profound influence on multiple fields, including\nmedicine, agriculture, manufacturing, and advertising. In software\ndevelopment, multiple techniques are used to define product\nrequirements; controlled experiments provide a valuable way to assess\nthe impact of new features on customer behavior.\n\nHaving run hundreds of experiments on more than 20 websites, including\nsome of the world\u2019s largest, like msn.com and bing.com, we have learned\nsome important practical lessons. These lessons, even for seemingly\nsimple univariate experiments, aren\u2019t taught in Statistics 101.\n",
