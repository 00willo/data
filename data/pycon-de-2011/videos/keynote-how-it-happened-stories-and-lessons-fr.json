Ever heard of it recently? Being a leader, then not, in a large open source project over a long period of time generates a lot of funny stories. And mistakes. And even, moments of wonder, not always intentionally.  In this talk I'll cover a number of insider stories from the life of Zope and Plone, then analyze them from the safety of perspective.
