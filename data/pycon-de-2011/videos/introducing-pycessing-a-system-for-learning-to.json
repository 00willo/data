  "title": "Introducing PyCessing - A System for Learning to Program", 
  "summary": "Python is a great language for teaching beginning programming but, until now, there was no simple integrated system that made it easy to get started.  PyCessing gives new users a simple integrated IDE and basic multi-media functionality that get users going without the distraction of complex tools or libraries.  It is based on emulating the success that Processing brought to teaching Java.",
