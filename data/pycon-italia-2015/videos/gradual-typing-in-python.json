  "description": "Gradual typing in dynamic languages is becoming popular. The\nimplementations for Python, Lua, Clojure and Racket show how a dynamic\nlanguage can be retrofitted with static type checking. This makes\npossible to combine the flexibility of these languages with the\nguarantees of a type checker and can be done in a gradual, non-invasive\nmanner. In this talk we\u2019ll understand what gradual typing is and the\nbenefits it yields, explore the existing implementations for Python and\ntalk about Guido\u2019s plans for the usage of function annotations\nintroduced in Python 3.\n",
