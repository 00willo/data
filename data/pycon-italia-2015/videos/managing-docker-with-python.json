  "description": "Looking at the most successful open source projects we have been\nseriously impressed by the importance of Docker: it is positively\nrevolutionizing the DevOps industry. Docker is a valid alternative to\nthe traditional virtual machines and it is redefining the IT service\ndeployment.\n\nThanks to the available Docker APIs, we have witnessed a remarkable\nproliferation of tools based on the same APIs to efficiently manage\nvirtual infrastructures: a place of honor, among of all of these, is\nreserved to the libraries and tools written in Python.\n\nThis talk is divided into two parts:\n\n-  The first part provides an introduction to Docker by illustrating a\n   typical use case: a network of micro-services aimed to manage a web\n   application.\n\n-  The second part goes into detail on how to write Python code which\n   will be able to orchestrate Docker images and containers.\n\n\n",
