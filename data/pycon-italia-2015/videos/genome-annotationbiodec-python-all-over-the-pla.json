  "summary": "", 
  "description": "The talk will briefly describe BioDec\u2019s genome annotation pipeline, which has\nbeen internally evolved for ten years to annotate mammalian, bacterial, and\nviral genomes at the protein level.\nEverything we built is coded in Python: the machine-learning annotation engine, the middleware and the data visualization interface.  A software that would have been extremely difficult to create, for a tiny shop as BioDec, without leveraging the language itself and projects such as BioPython, Scipy, Plone, and Web2py.\nWe will try to distill some of the lessons that we learned from more than ten years of experience dealing with machine-learning-intensive applications and large data sets with open-source software and Python.\n",
