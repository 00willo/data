  "description": "Say you have this piece of software that many people use. One day, you\nwake up and you have the urge to make them suffer. Well, there\u2019s no\nbetter way to do so than breaking the software they\u2019re using. In this\ntalk, I\u2019ll walk you through very good ways to do so by showing examples\ntaken from experience - because experience is the only thing that\nmatters (TM) - so that you\u2019ll be able, by the time this talk ends, to do\nthe same to your users. (P.S: If you\u2019ve a kinder hearth, you can also do\nthe exact oposite of what I\u2019ll say and keep your users happy.)\n",
