  "description": "Python for Zombies is the first MOOC (Massive Open Online Course) in portuguese. With a team made up of three folks and no budget, we have reached 30.000 enrollments in one year and half. After having taken the course, some former girl students even founded the first PyLadies groups in Brazil, with great impact in diversity (RuPy Natal: 300+ 1/3 women, Code Girl 2: 700+ 60% women). This MOOC also have a great impact in Python community: I gave 40 talk\u2019s and short courses in 2014!  \n",
