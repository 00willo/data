  "summary": "During this talk I\u2019ll show the architecture and the design pattern used to implement the CRAIS Appium broker.", 
  "description": "CRAIS acts as an Appium (1) broker, in order to spawn Appium servers as selenium grid nodes with specific capabilities using:\r\n\r\n* USB hotplug Mechanism for locally-connected devices, where CRAIS dinamically generate the node, registering itself to the hub,\r\n* RPC invocation, where CRAIS spawns ad-hoc appium server instances. The RPC method could be used to use remote android devices connected to the server using a reverse-ssh tunnel.\r\n\r\nCRAIS is based on:\r\n\r\n* ZODB object database for device storage (for both Hotplug & RPC), ConfigObj for configuration management, Pyro4, a library that enables to build applications in which objects can talk to each other over the network,\r\n* Cement as CLI framework.\r\n\r\nCRAIS is implemented in order to use the same Object Database in both RPC & Hotplug mode.\r\n\r\n(1) Appium is an open source test automation framework for use with native, hybrid and mobile web apps, used in B! to integrate Android / iOS testing in a QA automation infrastructure.\r\n\r\nPrerequisites:\r\n\r\n1. Selenium GRID specifications\r\n2. Acceptance testing knowledge\r\n3. Python multithreading & subprocess32 modules usage\r\n",
