  "description": "Django was actively supported at an early stage of the Python runtime in App Engine SDK through the notable django-nonrel framework, a fork of the original project that adds support for NoSql databases. But starting from the App Engine SDK 1.6.2, released more than two years ago, you can instead deploy Django\u2019s official releases and take advantages from the whole stack of the framework.\nIn less than half an hour we\u2019ll see how we can easily deploy the latest version of Django on the Google Cloud Platform, taking advantage of the tools and services provided by App Engine, Cloud SQL and Cloud Storage.\n",
