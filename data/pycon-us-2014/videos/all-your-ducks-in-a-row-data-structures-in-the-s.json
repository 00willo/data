  "title": "All Your Ducks In A Row: Data Structures in the Standard Library and Beyond", 
  "summary": "Why are Python programmers crazy about lists and dictionaries, when other languages tout bitmaps, linked lists, and B+ trees? Are we missing out? Come learn how data structures are implemented on bare metal, how to select the right data structure, how the list and dictionary cover a wide swath of use cases, and when to dip into the Standard Library or a\n third-party package for an alternative.",
