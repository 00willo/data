  "summary": "To many developers the database is a black box. You expect to be able to\nput data into your database, have it to stay there, and get it out when\nyou query it... hopefully in a performant manner. When its not\nperformant enough the two options are usually add some indexes or throw\nsome hardware at it. We'll walk through a bit of a clearer guide of how\nyou can understand and manage DB performance.\n",
