  "summary": "Unit testing is like public transit: everyone agrees it's a good thing\nfor other people to do. It's easier to swallow when you see how unit\ntesting improves not only the correctness of your code, but the design\nas well. I'll walk through a real-life case study where adding unit\ntests turned a pretty good module into an even better one: easier to\nunderstand, extend, and reuse.\n",
