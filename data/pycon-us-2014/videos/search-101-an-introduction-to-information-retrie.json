  "summary": "Data is everywhere! And most of the time, the best way to find what you want in a pile of data is to search it. In this project-based tutorial, you'll get an introduction to the basic theory of search and write a program to index and search a collection of Wikipedia documents using the Whoosh library. You'll leave with the ability to add search functionality to all of your own projects.",
