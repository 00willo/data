  "title": "Kneel And Disconnect: Getting The Fastest Connection Out Of A Hostname", 
  "summary": "Did you know that when you resolve a hostname, you can get multiple addresses back, and pick any one to connect to? Some of these addresses will connect near instantly, while others might take a long time or time out. This talk is about a Twisted endpoint API I built that takes a hostname, and returns the connection that takes the least time to complete, from the list of resolved host addresses.",
