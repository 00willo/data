  "title": "Programming an Autonomous 20 Foot Blimp with Python",
  "summary": "This talk documents the journey of a less than conventional robotics\napplication in which python is used as the logical controller of an\nautonomous 20 foot blimp. The blimp's autopilot features, prolonged air\ntime, large size, and smooth motion make it the ideal platform for\naerial photography. Giving the blimp an onboard controller reduces the\noverall costs and requirements of the operation.\n",
