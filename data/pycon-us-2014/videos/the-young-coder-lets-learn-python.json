  "summary": "Since PyCon 2013, interest in the Young Coders class has intensified.\nSeveral Python conferences have run their own, and classes outside of\nconferences - from one-time workshops to after school clubs - have\nsprung up as well. With more people than ever interested in teaching\nPython to kids, we're here to address how to organize a class. It takes\nsome effort to set up, but the payoff is enormous.\n",
