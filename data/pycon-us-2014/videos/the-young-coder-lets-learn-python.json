  "summary": "Since PyCon 2013, interest in the Young Coders class has intensified. Several Python conferences have run their own, and classes outside of conferences - from one-time workshops to after school clubs - have sprung up as well. With more people than ever interested in teaching Python to kids, we're here to address how to organize a class. It takes some effort to set up, but the payoff is enormous.",
