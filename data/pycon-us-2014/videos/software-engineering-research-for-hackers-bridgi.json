  "summary": "Software engineering researchers and hackers don't talk to each other as\nmuch as they ought to. This talk aims to bridge that gap, teach\npractitioners about what research is out there, and spark a \"citizen\nscience\" movement in software engineering. I'll explain how to study\nyour own projects and get academics to pay attention. Together, we can\nlearn how to develop better software.\n",
