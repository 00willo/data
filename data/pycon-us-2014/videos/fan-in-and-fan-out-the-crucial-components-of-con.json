  "title": "Fan-in and Fan-out: The crucial components of concurrency",
  "summary": "The most important yet underappreciated parts of concurrent APIs are\ngood constructs for fan-out (one thread spawns others) and fan-in (many\nthreads join together). This talk will show examples of fan-in and\nfan-out. It will cover the successes and shortcomings of APIs that\nprovide concurrency. Finally, we'll discuss how the async model of\nTulip/PEP3156 is the ultimate API. The future is bright!\n",
