  "title": "Fan-in and Fan-out: The crucial components of concurrency", 
  "summary": "The most important yet underappreciated parts of concurrent APIs are good constructs for fan-out (one thread spawns others) and fan-in (many threads join together). This talk will show examples of fan-in and fan-out. It will cover the successes and shortcomings of APIs that provide concurrency. Finally, we'll discuss how the async model of Tulip/PEP3156 is the ultimate API. The future is bright!",
