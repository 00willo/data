  "title": "Performance Testing and Profiling: A Virtuous Cycle", 
  "summary": "Donald Knuth famously said that we should avoid optimization 97% of the time and focus on the \"critical 3%\". How can we identify that 3%? How can we best focus our optimization efforts, and avoid the \"root of all evil\" that is premature optimization? This talk introduces key types of performance testing, and demonstrates how they can be paired with profiling techniques in a cycle of improvement.",
