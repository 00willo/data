  "summary": "",
  "description": "Python has been adopted by many disciplinary communities, showing its\nadaptability to many problems. Scientific computing and web development\nare two examples of such communities. These might, at first glance, seem\nto share few common interests, especially at the level of algorithms and\nlibraries. However, at the level of integrated practice in\ntime-constrained academic environments, where framework development is\nless valued than research and teaching productivity, ease of adoption of\ntools from each of these communities can be tremendously valuable.\n\nUsing examples from the recently-deployed West Texas Lightning Mapping\nArray, which is processed and visualized in real-time, this paper will\nargue that a shared sense, among disciplinary communities, of the\nessence of how one deploys Python for specific problems is beneficial\nfor continuation and growth of Python's status as a go-to language for\npractitioners in academic settings.\n",
