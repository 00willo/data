  "description": "Python has been adopted by many disciplinary communities, showing its\nadaptability to many problems. Scientific computing and web development are\ntwo examples of such communities. These might, at first glance, seem to share\nfew common interests, especially at the level of algorithms and libraries.\nHowever, at the level of integrated practice in time-constrained academic\nenvironments, where framework development is less valued than research and\nteaching productivity, ease of adoption of tools from each of these\ncommunities can be tremendously valuable.\n\nUsing examples from the recently-deployed West Texas Lightning Mapping Array,\nwhich is processed and visualized in real-time, this paper will argue that a\nshared sense, among disciplinary communities, of the essence of how one\ndeploys Python for specific problems is beneficial for continuation and growth\nof Python's status as a go-to language for practitioners in academic settings.\n\n",
