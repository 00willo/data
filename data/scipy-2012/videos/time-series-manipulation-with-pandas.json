  "description": "In this talk I'll discuss major developments in pandas over the last year\nrelated to time series handling and processing. This includes the integration\nof the new NumPy datetime64, implementation of rich and high performance\nresampling methods, better visualization, and a generally cleaner, more\nintuitive and productive API. I will also discuss how functionality from the\ndefunct scikits.timeseries project has been integrated into pandas, thus\nproviding a unified, cohesive set of time series tools for many different\nproblem domains. Lastly, I'll give some details about the pandas development\nroadmap and opportunities for more people to get involved.\n\n",
