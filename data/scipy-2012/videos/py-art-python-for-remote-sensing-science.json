  "description": "The drive to publish often leaves scientists working with old, inflexible,\npoorly documented dead end software. Even operational systems can end up being\na mash of legacy systems cobbled together. As the Atmospheric Radiation\nMeasurement (ARM) Climate Facility brings its 30+ cloud and precipitation\nsensitive radars into operation a concerted effort to modernize, modularize\nand adapt existing code and write new code to retrieve geophysical parameters\nfrom the remotely sensed signals. Due to the open nature, active development\ncommunity and lack of licensing issues Python is a natural development\nenvironment choice. This presentation will outline the challenges involved in\nretrieving model comparable geophysical parameters from scanning weather\nradars, introduce the framework behind the Python ARM Radar Toolkit (Py-ART)\nand discuss the challenges involved in building high performance code while\nmaintaining portability, readability and ease of use.\n\n",
