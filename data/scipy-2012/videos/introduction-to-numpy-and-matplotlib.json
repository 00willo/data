  "description": "NumPy is the most fundamental package for scientific computing with Python. It\nadds to the Python language a data structure (the NumPy array) that has access\nto a large library of mathematical functions and operations, providing a\npowerful framework for fast computations in multiple dimensions. NumPy is the\nbasis for all SciPy packages which extends vastly the computational and\nalgorithmic capabilities of Python as well as many visualization tools like\nMatplotlib, Chaco or Mayavi.\n\nThis tutorial will teach students the fundamentals of NumPy, including fast\nvector-based calculations on numpy arrays, the origin of its efficiency and a\nshort introduction to the matplotlib plotting library. In the final section,\nmore advanced concepts will be introduced including structured arrays,\nbroadcasting and memory mapping.\n\n",
