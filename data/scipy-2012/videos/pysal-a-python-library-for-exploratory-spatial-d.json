  "summary": "",
  "description": "This talk presents an overview and update of PySAL. PySAL is designed to\nsupport the development of high level applications in exploratory\nspatial data analysis and geocomputation. The library includes a\ncomprehensive suite of modules that cover the entire spatial data\nanalysis research stack from geospatial data processing and integration,\nto exploratory spatial data analysis, spatial dynamics, regionalization,\nand spatial econometrics. A selection of these modules are illustrated\ndrawing on research in spatial criminology, epidemiology and urban\ninequality dynamics. A number of geovisualization packages that have\nbeen implemented using PySAL as an analytical core are also\ndemonstrated. Future plans for additional modules and enhancements are\nalso discussed.\n",
