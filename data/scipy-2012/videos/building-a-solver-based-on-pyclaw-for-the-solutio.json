  "title": "Building a Solver Based on PyClaw for the Solution of the Multi-Layer Shallow Water Equations",
  "summary": "",
  "description": "The multi-layer shallow water equations are an active topic for\nresearchers in geophysical fluid dynamics looking for ways to increase\nthe validity of shallow water modeling techniques without using a fully\nthree dimensional model which may be too costly for the domain size\nbeing looked at. In this talk we will step through the effort needed to\nconvert a Fortran based solver to one using the PyClaw framework, a\nPython framework targeted at the solution of hyperbolic conservation\nlaws. Once the application is converted the ease of implementing\nparallel and other solver strategies is greatly simplified. Discussion\nof how this is accomplished and design decisions and future extensions\nto PyClaw will also be presented.\n",
