  "description": "In this talk, I'll describe the workings of my personal hobby project -\na self-driving lego mindstorms robot! The body of the robot is built\nwith Lego Mindstorms. An Android smartphone is used to capture the view\nin front of the robot. A user first teaches the robot how to drive; this\nis done by making the robot go around the track a small number of times.\nThe image data, along with the user action is used to train a Neural\nNetwork. At run-time, images of what is in front of the robot are fed\ninto the neural network and the appropriate driving action is selected.\nThis project showcases the power of python's libraries, as they enabled\nme to put together a sophisticated working system in a very short amount\nof time. Specifically, I made use of the Python Image Library to\ndownsample images, as well as the PyBrain neural network library. The\nrobot was controlled using the nxt-python library.
