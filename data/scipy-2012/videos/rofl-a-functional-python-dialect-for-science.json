  "summary": "", 
  "description": "Current parallel programming models leave a lot to be desired and fail to\nmaintain pace with improvements in hardware architecture. For many scientific\nresearch groups these models only widen the gap between equations and scalable\nparallel code. The Resilient Optimizing Flow Language (ROFL) is a data-flow\nlanguage designed with the purpose of solving the problems of both domain\nabstraction and efficient parallelism. Using a functional, declarative variant\nof the Python language, ROFL takes scientific equations and optimizes for both\nscalar and parallel execution.\n\nROFL is closely tied to Python and the SciPy libraries. ROFL uses Python\nexpression syntax, is implemented in Python, and emits optimized Python code.\nROFL's implementation in Python allows ROFL to be embedded in Python. Using\nPython as a target language makes ROFL extensible and portable. By removing\nimperative loop constructs and focusing on integration with the NumPy and\nSciPy libraries, ROFL both supports and encourages data parallelism.\n\nIn this presentation, we introduce the ROFL language, and demonstrate by\nexample how ROFL enables scientists to focus more on the equations they are\nsolving, and less on task and data parallelism.\n\n",
