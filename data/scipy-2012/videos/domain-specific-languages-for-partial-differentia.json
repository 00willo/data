  "description": "As scientific computing pushes towards extreme scales, the programming wall is\nbecoming more apparent. For algorithms to scale on new architectures, they\noften must be rewritten accounting for completely different performance\ncharacteristics. A handful of the communities fastest codes have already\nturned to automatic code generation to tackle these issues. Code generation\ngives a user the ability to use the expressiveness of a domain specific\nlanguage and promises for better portability as architectures rapidly change.\n\nIn this presentation, I will show Ignition, a project for creating numerical\ncode generators. Python and SymPy make exceptional languages for developing\nthese code generators in a way that domain experts can understand and\nmanipulate. I show examples how Ignition can generate several different parts\nof geophysical simulations.\n\n",
