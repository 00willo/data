  "description": "Matplotlib is one of the main plotting libraries in use within the scientific\nPython community. This tutorial covers advanced features of the Matplotlib\nlibrary, including many recent additions: laying out axes, animation support,\nBasemap (for plotting on maps), and other tweaks for creating aesthetic plots.\nThe goal of this tutorial is to expose attendees to several of the chief sub-\npackages within Matplotlib, helping to ensure that users maximize the use of\nthe full capabilities of the library. Additionally, the attendees will be run\nthrough a 'grab-bag' of tweaks for plots that help to increase the aesthetic\nappeal of created figures. Attendees should be familiar with creating basic\nplots in Matplotlib as well as basic use of NumPy for manipulating data.\n\n[iPython notebooks used in the tutorial](http://github.com/dopplershift\n/Python-Tutorials)\n\n",
