  "description": "This tutorial will give users an overview of the capabilities of\nstatsmodels, including how to conduct exploratory data analysis, fit\nstatistical models, and check that the modeling assumptions are met.\n\nThe use of Python in data analysis and statistics is growing rapidly. It\nis not uncommon now for researchers to conduct data cleaning steps in\nPython and then move to some other software to estimate statistical\nmodels. Statsmodels, however, is a Python module that attempts to bridge\nthis gap and allow users to estimate statistical models, perform\nstatistical tests, and conduct data exploration in Python. Researchers\nacross fields such as economics and the social sciences to finance and\nengineering may find that statsmodels meets their needs for statistical\ncomputing and data analysis in Python.\n\nAll examples in this tutorial will use real data. Attendees are expected\nto have some familiarity with statistical methods.\n\nWith this knowledge attendees will be ready to jump in and use Python\nfor applied statistical analysis and will have an idea how they can\nextend statsmodels for their own needs.\n",
