  "description": "Come hear about the tools, technology, corporate structure, and ethos\nthat lets GitHub use GitHub to build GitHub. From a couple of guys in a\ncoffee shop to almost 100 employees, millions of users, and massive open\nsource projects that are powering businesses around the world, it's been\na bit of a wild ride. Hear about some lessons learned and challenges\nwe've faced: things we've done right and others that didn't work out so\nwell. Learn a little bit about our growing technology stack and how we\ndesign and deploy features. Get some insight into why we still have no\nmanagers and how everyone decides what to work on. Finally, hear about\nhow open source has shaped the company and our vision of 'open' in\neverything from hardware to politics to education and science. The\nsocial web is old news, but the collaborative web is just in its infancy\nand GitHub sees that as a very bright future.\n",
