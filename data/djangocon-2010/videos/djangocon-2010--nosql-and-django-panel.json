  "description": "NoSQL and Django Panel\n\nFeaturing Jacob Burch, Russel Keith-Magee, Noah Silas, Michael Richardson,\nEric Florenzano, Curt Micol\n\nA panel to discuss the future of no-sql/non-related databases in Django.\n\nAbstract\n\nThe proliferation of non-SQL speaking datastores has caused a lot of discourse\nand debate over their potential role in Django's decidedly SQL-speaking ORM.\nThe goal of this panel is to consolidate and discuss the root questions of\nthis debate.\n\nThe panel will consist of Django orm contributors and heavy end-users of both\nDjango and a variety of NoSQL database solutions. Questions to the panel will\nbriefly cover the NoSQL movement in general and it's staying power. After that\nintroduction to the debates at hand outside of Django, questions will shift to\nfocus closely on the issues into integrating NoSQL and Django--both on current\nbest practices and future plans for integrating it into the core.\n\n",
