  "description": "Pony Pwning\n\nAdam Baldwin\n\nDjango's awesomeness unfortunately doesn't make it impenetrable. This talk\nwill cover common pitfalls of the Django developer as seen through the eyes of\na hacker or malicious user.\n\nAbstract\n\nDjango is arguably the most secure web framework. The Django team have done an\nexcellent job making secure-by-default decisions for our web applications in\nmany situations. Still, the last mile in development is where the bulk of\nsecurity vulnerabilities can be introduced and Django's powerful flexibility\nallows for plenty of rope for developers to hang themselves. Understanding the\nvulnerabilities that can be created by common mistakes or misconceptions and\noverlooked details in development will be useful for any Django user.\n\n",
