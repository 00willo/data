  "description": "Why Django Sucks, and How We Can Fix It\n\nPresented by Eric Florenzano\n\nEric Florenzano trolls DjangoCon. He identifies problems with Django ranging\nfrom app structure, to settings, to the development process, to the community,\nand more. Some of the problems he identifies have been around since the\nbeginning, and some are emerging as Django matures. It's not all gloom\u2014the\nlatter half of the talk focuses on proposals on how to tackle these issues\nthat face Django.\n\nAbstract\n\nThis talk focuses on real problems that people face when using Django every\nday. It dives down and attempts to find root causes for each of these\nproblems. Essentially, what are the things that suck about Django?\n\nThen the talk walks point-by-point for each of the things that suck, and\nprovides suggestions for actions that the Django community can take to make\nthem suck less.\n\nThe goal here is to start a discussion, to bring to light the problems that\ntend to be ignored, and to have a little fun in the process.\n\n",
