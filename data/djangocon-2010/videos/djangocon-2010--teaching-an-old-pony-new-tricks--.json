This talk will\ndiscuss the process for designing the PBS TeacherLine codebase, how new\nadvanced features were added over the years, and pitfalls you can avoid when\nplanning projects for longevity and easy maintenance.\n\nAbstract\n\nPBS chose Django after seeing a presentation by Jacob Kaplan-Moss and Adrian\nHolovaty at OSCON 2006. That Fall, PBS Education began work on a new version\nof the PBS TeacherLine website. The site most users see when they visit PBS\nTeacherLine is essentially a brochure and catalog that allows educators to\npurchase seats in online professional development courses. However, behind the\nscenes is an administrative infrastructure that allows over 50 PBS stations\nand PBS national staff members to administrate hundreds of course sections and\nover ten thousand learners every year. There are robust features for\naccounting, reporting, student and staff management just to name a few.\n\nThe TeacherLine website was initially written using Django 0.96. The site is\ncurrently running Django 1.2 and has had major upgrades made to some of the\ncore systems including the implementation of a robust message queue solution\nto handle the most intense administrative functions. Over the past four years,\nthe PBS Education Technology Team has learned many lessons about system\ndesign, best practices, handling upgrades, and creating Django-based code that\nis flexible and easy to maintain.\n\nIn this discussion we will look at some of the more interesting points in the\nhistory of PBS TeacherLine, including design patterns, workarounds that were\neventually made obsolete by improvements in the Django framework, and the\nprocess of iteratively improving functionality and features. We will discuss\nsuccesses and failures, including the pitfalls we avoided and (perhaps more\ninterestingly) those we did not.\n\n", "video_mp4_url": null, "tags": ["djangocon", "djangocon2010", "maintenance", "updating"], "copyright_text": "Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 3.0", "related_urls": [], "video_flv_download_only": false, "source_url": "", "video_webm_url": null, "video_ogv_length": 204938002, "video_ogv_url": null, "language": "English", "video_webm_length": null, "summary": "", "thumbnail_url": "http://a.images.blip.tv/Robertlofthouse-TeachingAnOldPonyNewTricksMaintainingAndUpdatingAnAgin531-41.jpg", "video_flv_url": "http://05d2db1380b6504cc981-8cbed8cf7e3a131cd8f1c3e383d10041.r93.cf2.rackcdn.com/djangocon-2010/65_teaching-an-old-pony-new-tricks-maintaining-and-updating-an-aging-django-project.flv"}
