  "description": "NumPy arrays combine the speed of C with the convenience of Python. It\nis the fundamental package for scientific and statistical computing in\nPython. MongoDB\u2019s scale, speed, and flexibility make it ideal for\nstoring large amounts of data. However, the official MongoDB driver is\nnot optimized for loading MongoDB documents into NumPy arrays. Enter\n\u201cMonary\u201d, which allows you to easily examine and manipulate data using\nNumPy arrays. We will explore how Monary can accelerate your scientific\nanalysis while providing you with the scale and flexibility of MongoDB\nand the ease of Python.\n",
