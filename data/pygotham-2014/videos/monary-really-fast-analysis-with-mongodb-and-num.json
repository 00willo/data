  "summary": "", 
  "description": "NumPy arrays combine the speed of C with the convenience of Python. It is the fundamental package for scientific and statistical computing in Python. MongoDB\u2019s scale, speed, and flexibility make it ideal for storing large amounts of data. However, the official MongoDB driver is not optimized for loading MongoDB documents into NumPy arrays. Enter \u201cMonary\u201d, which allows you to easily examine and manipulate data using NumPy arrays. We will explore how Monary can accelerate your scientific analysis while providing you with the scale and flexibility of MongoDB and the ease of Python.",
