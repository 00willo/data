  "summary": "", 
  "description": "Bitly provides functionality in our API and clients by implementing microservices, a trendy new word that describes a service-oriented architecture built using some common-sense guidelines. We use the Tornado web framework to implement these services, along with a liberal sprinkling of other languages and tools.
