  "summary": "", 
  "description": "Matt's obsession with Python's rich comparison methods started about 6 years ago with a gnarly bug and some bad assumptions. A few long nights and a lot of reading later, the docs corrected my assumption:\r\n\r\nThere are no implied relationships among the comparison operators. The truth of x==y does not imply that x!=y is false.\r\nMind == blown and mind != blown. In Getting Rich with Comparison Methods we'll start by learning how to avoid common and costly bugs in your rich comparison methods, learn a bit about which methods are executed in comparisons and why, and then go beyond symmetrical comparisons exploring some of the ways we can take full advantage of asymmetrical comparison methods.",
