  "summary": "",
  "description": "Matt's obsession with Python's rich comparison methods started about 6\nyears ago with a gnarly bug and some bad assumptions. A few long nights\nand a lot of reading later, the docs corrected my assumption:\n\nThere are no implied relationships among the comparison operators. The\ntruth of x==y does not imply that x!=y is false. Mind == blown and mind\n!= blown. In Getting Rich with Comparison Methods we'll start by\nlearning how to avoid common and costly bugs in your rich comparison\nmethods, learn a bit about which methods are executed in comparisons and\nwhy, and then go beyond symmetrical comparisons exploring some of the\nways we can take full advantage of asymmetrical comparison methods.\n",
