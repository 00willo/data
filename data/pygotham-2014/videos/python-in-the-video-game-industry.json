  "description": "Python is used extensively in the video game industry at many levels.\nThis talk is specifically about how Python based analytics can be\nintegrated operationally into an organization at two levels: in ad hoc\ninvestigations and in production analytic services. This is about best\npractices in documented, reproducible and archived data investigations\nas well as production development with Python. A case study of an\nanalytic service for cheating detection in Call of Duty Ghosts will make\nthis real and provide some fun. This talk is rated PG-13 for some\nawesome video game violence.\n",
