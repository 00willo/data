  "description": "Building service oriented web apps is a great way to separate concerns, parallelize development, and scale high traffic apps. One of the downsides of service oriented web applications, however, is managing the high overhead of communication between services, and handling the additional complexities that come along with service driven development.\r\n\r\nIn this presentation, Randall Degges, Stormpath Developer Evangelist and OpenCNAM co-founder, will share all of the best practices he learned while building OpenCNAM, supporting billions of API requests.",
