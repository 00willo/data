  "description": "If you're new to Python, you might find that you're using Python as if it were C. This talk will demonstrate how to take advantage of Python's special data structures to build tools for analyzing and creating nicely-formatted reports from CSV data. (\"CSV\" stands for \"Comma Separated Values\" although the term describes flat files where the fields in each row are delimited by commas, or tabs, or pipe characters, or whatever. )",
