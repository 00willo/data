  "description": "The Zen of Python dictates that there should be one - and preferably only one - obvious way to do something. However, when it comes to interoperation with C and C++, there is a multitude of options: the Python C API, Boost.Python, ctypes, cffi, Cython. I will describe my quest to find the **holy grail**^W^W **right interface** for a high-performance networking library.\r\n\r\nThe talk is largely a case study in applying Boost.Python, and will look at some issues such as the Global Interpreter Lock, handling KeyboardInterrupt cleanly, and managing object lifetime. I will briefly mention some of the alternative tools to explain why I settled on Boost.Python. It is not a complete Boost.Python tutorial, but rather aims to give a sense of the flavour and show how it's used in a real application.\r\n\r\nFor obvious reasons, this talk will have a lot of C++ code in it, and some familiarity with C++ will be useful.",
