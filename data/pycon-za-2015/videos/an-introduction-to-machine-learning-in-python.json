  "description": "In this tutorial, two main areas will be covered using Textural Images Dataset:\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>Textural Features Methods: (Grey Level Co-occurrence Matrix(GLCM), Local Binary Pattern(LBP) and Local Directional Pattern(LDP))</li>\r\n<li>Classification using Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Naive Bayes(NB).</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\nBoth Features Extraction and Classification will be implemented using Python.\r\n\r\nTexture is a very important factor in computer vision; it represents the first level of spatial properties that can be extracted from digital image. Texture can be defined as relationship between gray level in neighboring pixels.\r\n",
