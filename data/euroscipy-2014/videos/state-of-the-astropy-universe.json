  "description": "The [Astropy Project](http://www.astropy.org/) is a community effort to develop a single core package\r\nfor Astronomy in Python and foster interoperability between Python astronomy\r\npackages. In addition an ecosystem of [Astropy affiliated packages](http://www.astropy.org/affiliated/index.html) is\r\ngrowing, some of which are planned for inclusion in the Astropy core when\r\nthey are matured, some with specialised functionality will remain as\r\nseparate repositories.\r\n\r\nI will give an overview of the features and implementation of the Astropy\r\npackage, focusing on parts that are more generally useful for scientists and\r\nengineers (e.g. [astropy.units](http://docs.astropy.org/en/latest/units/index.html) and [astropy.modeling](http://docs.astropy.org/en/latest/modeling/index.html)) and highlight recent\r\ndevelopments in the core and affiliated packages.\r\n",
