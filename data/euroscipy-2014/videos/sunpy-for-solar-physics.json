  "description": "SunPy is a data-analysis library specialising in providing the software necessary to analyse solar and heliospheric datasets in Python. SunPy is open-source software (BSD licence) and has an open and transparent development workflow that anyone can contribute to. SunPy provides access to solar data through use of the Virtual Solar Observatory (VSO), the Heliophysics Event Knowledgebase (HEK), and the HELiophysics Integrated Observatory (HELIO) webservice APIs. It currently supports image data from major solar missions (e.g., SDO, SOHO, STEREO, and IRIS), time-series data from missions such as GOES, SDO/EVE, and PROBA2/LYRA, and radio spectra from ground-based e-Callisto and STEREO/SWAVES. This talk describes SunPy's core functionality, provides examples of solar data analysis in SunPy and layouts the roadmap for SunPy's future.",
