  "description": "Random Forests are without contest one of the most robust, accurate and\nversatile tools for solving machine learning tasks. Implementing this\nalgorithm properly and efficiently remains however a challenging task\ninvolving issues that are easily overlooked if not considered with care.\nIn this talk, we present the Random Forests implementation developed\nwithin the Scikit-Learn machine learning library. In particular, we\ndescribe the iterative team efforts that led us to gradually improve our\ncodebase and eventually make Scikit-Learn's Random Forests one of the\nmost efficient implementations in the scientific ecosystem, across all\nlibraries and programming languages. Algorithmic and technical\noptimizations that have made this possible include:\n\n-  An efficient formulation of the decision tree algorithm, tailored for\n   Random Forests;\n-  Cythonization of the tree induction algorithm;\n-  CPU cache optimizations, through low-level organization of data into\n   contiguous memory blocks;\n-  Efficient multi-threading through GIL-free routines;\n-  A dedicated sorting procedure, taking into account the properties of\n   data;\n-  Shared pre-computations whenever critical.\n\nOverall, we believe that lessons learned from this case study extend to\na broad range of scientific applications and may be of interest to\nanybody doing data analysis in Python.\n",
