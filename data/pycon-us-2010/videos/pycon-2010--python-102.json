It pairs well with Python\n101 which follows a similar outline but at a more introductory level.\n\nRather than starting with \"Hello, world!\", we use the interactive Python\ninterpreter shell to get hands-on familiarity with much of core Python before\ncovering blocks and scripts.\n\nThe tutorial is divided into short sections, each with presentation and hands-\non exercises, to quickly cover lots of ground.\n\nAdvanced topics are introduced throughout and covered in \"extra credit\"\nexercises such that more advanced participants can learn at their own pace.\n\nIntended Audience\n\nProgrammers with experience in other languages who want a fast hands-on\nintroduction to intermediate and some advanced features of Python. Content\nwill target both Python 3.1 and 2.6.\n\nClass Outline\n\n  * Numbers and Strings - operators, functions and methods \n  * Introspection \n  * Sequences - overview, concepts, and methods \n  * Objects \n  * Dictionaries \n  * Files \n  * Classes \n  * Namespaces \n  * Dynamic Classes \n  * Iterators and Generators \n  * Functions \n  * Exceptions \n  * Standard Library \n\nRequirements\n\nBring a laptop computer with Python 2.6 or 3.1 installed. Try to get as much\nof an overview of Python before the tutorial as you have time to in order to\nget more out of the tutorial. Two angles on this are the Python Quick\nReference and the Python website's tutorial.\n\n", "video_mp4_url": "http://05d2db1380b6504cc981-8cbed8cf7e3a131cd8f1c3e383d10041.r93.cf2.rackcdn.com/pycon-us-2010/257_python-102.m4v", "tags": ["pycon", "pycon2010", "python-basics", "tutorial"], "copyright_text": "Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 3.0", "related_urls": [], "video_flv_download_only": false, "source_url": "", "video_webm_url": null, "video_ogv_length": null, "video_ogv_url": "http://05d2db1380b6504cc981-8cbed8cf7e3a131cd8f1c3e383d10041.r93.cf2.rackcdn.com/pycon-us-2010/257_python-102.ogv", "language": "English", "video_webm_length": null, "summary": "", "thumbnail_url": "http://a.images.blip.tv/Pycon-PyCon2010Python102442.png", "video_flv_url": null}
