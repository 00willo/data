  "description": "Threading is not a model\n\n  \nPresented by Joe Gregorio\n\n  \nWe have many concurrency/multiprocessing capabilities at our finger tips, such\nas threads, processes, locks, mutexes, select, epoll, transactional memory,\netc. But none of them are a model for multiprocessing, they are only tools on\nwhich you would build an implementation of such a model. So what are the\nmodels we can choose from? How would they be implemented in Python? And why\nmay the GIL actually be a good thing?\n\n",
