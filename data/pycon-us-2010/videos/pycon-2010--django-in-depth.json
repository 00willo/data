  "description": "Django In Depth\n\nPresented by James Bennett\n\nMost books, tutorials and other documentation for Django take a high-level\napproach to its components and APIs, and so barely scratch the surface of the\nframework. In this tutorial, however, we'll take a detailed look under the\nhood, covering everything from the guts of the ORM to the innards of the\ntemplate system to how the admin interface really works.\n\nWhether you're the newest of newbies or the most seasoned of application\ndevelopers, you'll come away with a deeper knowledge of Django, and a plethora\nof new tips and tricks you can use in your own applications.\n\nIntended Audience\n\nBeginning to intermediate users of the Django web framework.\n\nClass Outline\n\n  * Introduction: going beyond Django's documentation \n  * Under the hood of the ORM \n  * Forms and validation \n  * Inside the template system \n  * How Django processes requests \n  * Understanding the view layer \n  * The admin interface, inside and out \n  * Q&A;\n\n[VIDEO HAS ISSUES: Cam frezz from time to time]\n\n",
