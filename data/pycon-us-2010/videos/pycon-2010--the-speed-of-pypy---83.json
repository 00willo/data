  "description": "The Speed of PyPy\n\nPresented by Maciej Fijalkowski (merlinux GmbH, pypy)\n\nThe first part of the talk will cover PyPy's speed achievements\nresulting from the last year's work on the Just-In-Time Compiler. I'll\npresent and discuss a number of benchmarks and compare against other\nPython-speed projects. I'll also cover the basics of how the JIT works\nand what sort of programs it can greatly speedup (and which ones it\ncan't).\n",
