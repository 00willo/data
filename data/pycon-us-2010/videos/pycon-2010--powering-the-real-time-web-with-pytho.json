  "description": "Powering the real-time web with Python: PubSubHubbub on App Engine\n\n  \nPresented by Brett Slatkin\n\n  \nPubSubHubbub is an open protocol that turns Atom and RSS feeds into real-time\nstreams. I built the reference Hub run by Google using Python and App Engine.\nIn this talk you will learn how I made the real-time system work: An intro to\nthe protocol, asynchronous processing on App Engine, fault-tolerance, and\nscalability.\n\n  \nFor details on PubSubHubbub and the Hub's source code, see [http://code.google\n.com/p/pubsubhubbub/](http://code.google.com/p/pubsubhubbub/).\n\n",
