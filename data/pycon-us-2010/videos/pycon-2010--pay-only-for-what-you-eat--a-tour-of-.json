It is a \"pay only for\nwhat you eat\" framework. Meaning that you can get started easily and learn new\nconcepts as you go, and only if you need them. It's simple, well tested, well\ndocumented, and fast. It also tries to make development fun.\n\n  \nThis talk will introduce the framework and its philosophy, including\nsimilarities and differences with other frameworks. I will then show some of\nthe software available in its repository and discuss the inclusive, loose\nconnection approach that the BFG community prefers for creating a flexible web\ndevelopment platform.\n\n", "video_mp4_url": "http://05d2db1380b6504cc981-8cbed8cf7e3a131cd8f1c3e383d10041.r93.cf2.rackcdn.com/pycon-us-2010/295_pay-only-for-what-you-eat-a-tour-of-the-repoze-bfg-repository-and-philosophy-174.m4v", "tags": ["pycon", "pycon2010", "repoze.bfg", "wsgi"], "copyright_text": "Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 3.0", "related_urls": [], "video_flv_download_only": false, "source_url": "", "video_webm_url": null, "video_ogv_length": null, "video_ogv_url": "http://05d2db1380b6504cc981-8cbed8cf7e3a131cd8f1c3e383d10041.r93.cf2.rackcdn.com/pycon-us-2010/295_pay-only-for-what-you-eat-a-tour-of-the-repoze-bfg-repository-and-philosophy-174.ogv", "language": "English", "video_webm_length": null, "summary": "", "thumbnail_url": "http://a.images.blip.tv/Pycon-PyCon2010PayOnlyForWhatYouEatATourOfTheRepozeBFGRepo556.png", "video_flv_url": null}
