  "description": "New *and* Improved: Coming changes to unittest, the standard library test\nframework\n\n  \nPresented by Michael J Foord\n\n  \nIn Python 2.7 and 3.2 a whole bunch of improvements to unittest will arrive.\nunittest is the Python standard library testing framework and for several\nyears it has languished whilst other Python testing frameworks have innovated.\nSome of the best innovations have made their way into unittest which has had\nquite a renovation.\n\n  \nThis talk will go through the major changes, like the new assert methods, test\ndiscovery and the load_tests protocol, and also explain how they can be used\nwith earlier versions of Python.\n\n",
