  "description": "Using Python to Create Robotic Simulations for Planetary Exploration (#159)\n\nPresented by Dr. Jonathan M Cameron (Jet Propulsion Laboratory (NASA))\n\nThe primary activity of the Dartslab (http://dartslab.jpl.nasa.gov) at Jet\nPropulsion Laboratory (JPL) is to create simulations of robotic vehicles for\nplanetary exploration. We have created simulations of a wide variety of\nrobotic vehicles such as spacecraft, rovers, and airships. We have been using\nPython in a variety of ways to build our simulations. In this talk we will\noutline how we use Python to set up a runtime environment for our simulations\nand to tie together computationally intense C++ code modules at runtime. We\nwill also discuss how we have been using Python to help prototype and design\nC++ code.\n\n",
