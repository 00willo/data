  "description": "Eventlet: Asynchronous I/O with a synchronous interface\n\nPresented by Donovan Preston\n\nNetwork servers which scale to thousands of simultaneous connections have\nalways been possible in Python thanks to libraries such as asyncore and\ntwisted. More recently, FriendFeed's new open source project Tornado has\nstirred debate in this area. These libraries allow a Python process to scale\nto many simultaneous connections using non-blocking I/O (also known as\nasynchronous I/O). However these projects require that the programmer learn a\ncustom API to abstract away the complexities of using a callback-style API.\n\nEventlet uses greenlet, which provides coroutines as described in \"The Art of\nComputer Programming\", to implement efficient cooperative concurrency while\nretaining synchronous semantics. Eventlet also provides an implementation of\nthe standard library's socket module. Code written to use Python's standard\nsocket library can be transparently converted to use nonblocking I/O and green\nthreads with eventlet. This leads to much greater code reuse and programmer\nefficiency.\n\n[http://www.eventlet.net/](http://www.eventlet.net/)\n\n",
