Where does competition help and where does it\nhamper?\n\nIn this interactive talk I'll highlight the main strengths of each of\nthe Python interpreters. Furthermore, I'll discuss ways to leverage\nPython interpreters in a co-operative way, discuss challenges, projects\nand issues ahead and also briefly highlight 'execnet', one my own\nprojects for bridging (Any) Python to (Any) Python. This is also the\nfirst time i am going to try out a new and funvisual presentation\ntechnique after several years of having done mostly text-based ones\n",
