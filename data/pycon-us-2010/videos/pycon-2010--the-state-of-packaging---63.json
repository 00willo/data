As long as you use Distutils standards, you can\nregister and upload your work at PyPI in a few seconds.\n\n  \nProjects like Setuptools and Pip added great features on the top of this : the\nability to fetch PyPI to install a project and its dependencies. So you can\n\"easy_install A-Program\" and everything is done automatically for you.\n\n  \nBut all these features have shown the flaws and limitations of the current\nDistutils design, and the urgency to make it evolve with respect to the\nexisting OS-specific packaging systems.\n\n  \nThis talk will detail the biggest issues that need to be solved, and the work\nthat is being done. It will end up with a presentation of the Distutils\nroadmap, and an overview of the Distribute project, the Setuptools replacer.\n\n", "video_mp4_url": "http://05d2db1380b6504cc981-8cbed8cf7e3a131cd8f1c3e383d10041.r93.cf2.rackcdn.com/pycon-us-2010/283_the-state-of-packaging-63.m4v", "tags": ["distribute", "distutils", "easy_install", "packaging", "pip", "pycon", "pycon2010", "pypi", "setuptools"], "copyright_text": "Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 3.0", "related_urls": [], "video_flv_download_only": false, "source_url": "", "video_webm_url": null, "video_ogv_length": 213007664, "video_ogv_url": "http://05d2db1380b6504cc981-8cbed8cf7e3a131cd8f1c3e383d10041.r93.cf2.rackcdn.com/pycon-us-2010/283_the-state-of-packaging-63.ogv", "language": "English", "video_webm_length": null, "summary": "", "thumbnail_url": "http://a.images.blip.tv/Pycon-PyCon2010TheStateOfPackaging63241-136.jpg", "video_flv_url": null}
