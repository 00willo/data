  "description": "Mastering Team Play: Four powerful examples of composing Python tools\n\n  \nPresented by Raymond Hettinger\n\n  \nStarts with a quick review of the performance characteristics of major\nindividual tools in Python: bisect, heapq, lists, deques, sets, frozensets,\nclass structures, sorts, and weakreferences. Show how these tools can be\npowerfully combined to create elegant solutions to four hard problems.\n\n  1. Random sampling: when one data structure isn't enough. Discuss how the nature of the problem dictates when to use one of two alternate data structures. \n  2. Ordered dictionaries: with the right compostion of dictionaries, linked lists, and weak references, a dictionary can remember its insertion order without any impact on its big-Oh running times. \n  3. NFA to DFA conversion. The classic, but difficult, algorithm for lexical analysis becomes simple when composing Python's dicts and frozensets. \n  4. Running median: the obvious approaches are horribly slow. The problem centers around how to efficiently maintain sorted data while advancing a large sliding window one value at a time. A list of deques provides a dramatic and scalable improvement in running time. \n\n",
