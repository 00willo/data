  "description": "Python in quantitative finance\n\nPresented by Wes McKinney (AQR Capital Management, LLC)\n\nThis talk will show how Python and libraries such as NumPy were\ninstrumental at AQR for building a robust research platform for\nprototyping and implementing quantitative trading models. We will\ndiscuss many different tools, including pandas, a new open source\nlibrary designed for analyzing common financial and economic data sets.\n\nA variety of examples will be presented to explore Python's current\nstatus as a replacement for other statistical computing environments (as\ncompared with R, MATLAB, or other commercial and open-source statistical\nproducts).\n",
