  "description": "Turtles all the way down: Demystifying deferreds, decorators and\ndeclarations\n\nPresented by Glyph Lefkowitz\n\nPython's flexible object model allows library and framework authors to\nadd very flexible declarations. Metaclasses, decorators, callable\nobjects, and operator overloading practically allow libraries to\nre-define the language in order to provide a more concise, natural style\nfor that library. Unfortunately, the library user's first experience of\nsuch conveniences is often confusing, because it's not clear what's\ngoing on.\n\nIn this talk, I will try to convince you that all of this wonderful\nmagic isn't all that weird. This is not a typical how-to session on how\nto use a particular feature, either of Python or of Twisted, but will\nrather draw examples from Python, Twisted, and Zope to illustrate\ntechniques you can use to read and understand \"magical\" Python code.\n",
