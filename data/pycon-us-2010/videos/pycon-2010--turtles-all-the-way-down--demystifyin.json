  "description": "Turtles all the way down: Demystifying deferreds, decorators and declarations\n\n  \nPresented by Glyph Lefkowitz\n\n  \nPython's flexible object model allows library and framework authors to add\nvery flexible declarations. Metaclasses, decorators, callable objects, and\noperator overloading practically allow libraries to re-define the language in\norder to provide a more concise, natural style for that library.\nUnfortunately, the library user's first experience of such conveniences is\noften confusing, because it's not clear what's going on.\n\n  \nIn this talk, I will try to convince you that all of this wonderful magic\nisn't all that weird. This is not a typical how-to session on how to use a\nparticular feature, either of Python or of Twisted, but will rather draw\nexamples from Python, Twisted, and Zope to illustrate techniques you can use\nto read and understand \"magical\" Python code.\n\n",
