  "description": "Why not run all your tests at all the time? A study of continuous integration\nsystems\n\n  \nPresented by Dr. C. Titus Brown (Michigan State University)\n\n  \nThere are an increasing number of continuous integration (CI) systems\navailable for use by Pythonistas, but no clear guide to how to choose a CI\nsystem for your project. I will examine the architecture choices made by\nbuildbot, bitten, Hudson, continuum, CruiseControl, DART, and pony-build, and\ndiscuss the configuration and customization of several of these systems for\nPythonic needs, as well as give short demos (for buildbot, bitten, Hudson, and\npony-build).\n\n",
