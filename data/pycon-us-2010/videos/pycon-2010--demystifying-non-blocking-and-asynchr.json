  "description": "Demystifying non-blocking and asynchronous I/O\n\n  \nPresented by Peter A Portante\n\n  \nWe will first define what blocking, non-blocking, synchronous and asynchronous\nI/O are under the POSIX interfaces. We'll cover how and when these four types\nof I/O should be used, and their individual effects on a Python based\napplication. The notion of concurrency will be discussed by comparing a simple\nthreaded blocking I/O application to a simple single threaded non-blocking I/O\napplication by walking the attendees through the python code for those\napplications.\n\n",
