  "description": "Persistent Graphs in Python with Neo4j\n\nPresented by Tobbias Ivarsson\n\nDatabases that employ a data model other than the relational model are\nincreasingly a hot topic. Neo4j is an open source database where the\ndata model is a graph. Data in Neo4j is stored as Nodes and\nRelationships in between nodes. A lot of the data we model in\napplications every day is actually graph oriented, having a database\nthat persists such data natively is a huge benefit. In this presentation\nwe will see how to use Neo4j in Python, and demonstrate this with a web\napplication in Django.\n",
