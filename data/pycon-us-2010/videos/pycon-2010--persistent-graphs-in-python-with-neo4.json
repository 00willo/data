  "description": "Persistent Graphs in Python with Neo4j\n\n  \nPresented by Tobbias Ivarsson\n\n  \nDatabases that employ a data model other than the relational model are\nincreasingly a hot topic. Neo4j is an open source database where the data\nmodel is a graph. Data in Neo4j is stored as Nodes and Relationships in\nbetween nodes. A lot of the data we model in applications every day is\nactually graph oriented, having a database that persists such data natively is\na huge benefit. In this presentation we will see how to use Neo4j in Python,\nand demonstrate this with a web application in Django.\n\n",
