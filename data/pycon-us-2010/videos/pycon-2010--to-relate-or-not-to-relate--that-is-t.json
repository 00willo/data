  "description": "To relate or not to relate, that is the question\n\nPresented by Mark Ramm\n\nThere is a lot of buzz about Couch, Casandra, MongoDB, and other non\nrelational databases, and at the same time there are decades of hard\nwork that's gone into optimizing databases built around the relational\nmodel. This talk will focus on comparing relational DB's to their new\nfriends in practice, and on providing practical tools for deciding\nwhat's right for your project.\n",
