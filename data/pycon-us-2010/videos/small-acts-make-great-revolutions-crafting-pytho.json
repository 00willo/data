  "description": "Small acts make great revolutions: crafting Python and Open Source\ncommunities in Rio de Janeiro\n\nPresented by Guilherme Chapiewski; Henrique Bastos\n\nEven though we are Python lovers, we at PythOnRio (Python's Rio de\nJaneiro users group) strongly believe in differences. Programming\nlanguages and technologies are not religions. Why do we have to compete\nagainst each other when we can take advantage of diversity by sharing\nour knowledge and learning to use the best tools for each job? By\npromoting this thinking we are gathering people from many different open\nsource communities.\n\nThat's our main recipe for the success of initiatives like Coding Dojo\nRio, PythOnCampus, Dev in Rio, #horaextra and many other social meetings\nwhere we have gathered some of the smartest people in Rio's software\ndevelopment community.\n\nWith this philosophy, Rio de Janeiro communities are growing and\nstarting to jell - they are becoming so strongly knit that the whole is\ngreater than the sum of the parts.\n\nIn this talk, we would like to share not only our \"methods\" and\n\"formulas\", but the values and experiences that are leading us to build\na strong and active community while having lots of fun.\n",
