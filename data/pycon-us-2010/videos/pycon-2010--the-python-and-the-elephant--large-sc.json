Recently, the Python\ncommunity has seen the release of Dumbo ([http://wiki.github.com/klbostee/dumb\no](http://wiki.github.com/klbostee/dumbo)), an open-source, python-based\ncloud-computing API (based on Hadoop) via the hands of Klaas Bosteels.\n\n  \nIn this talk, we show how the amalgamation of Python, NLTK and Dumbo can allow\nfor very large-scale natural language processing efficiently and elegantly.\n\n", "video_mp4_url": "http://05d2db1380b6504cc981-8cbed8cf7e3a131cd8f1c3e383d10041.r93.cf2.rackcdn.com/pycon-us-2010/335_the-python-and-the-elephant-large-scale-natural-language-processing-with-nltk-and-dumbo-120.m4v", "tags": ["dumbo", "nltk", "pycon", "pycon2010"], "copyright_text": "Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 3.0", "related_urls": [], "video_flv_download_only": false, "source_url": "", "video_webm_url": null, "video_ogv_length": null, "video_ogv_url": "http://05d2db1380b6504cc981-8cbed8cf7e3a131cd8f1c3e383d10041.r93.cf2.rackcdn.com/pycon-us-2010/335_the-python-and-the-elephant-large-scale-natural-language-processing-with-nltk-and-dumbo-120.ogv", "language": "English", "video_webm_length": null, "summary": "", "thumbnail_url": "http://a.images.blip.tv/Pycon-PyCon2010ThePythonAndTheElephantLargeScaleNaturalLangua697.png", "video_flv_url": null}
