  "description": "Import this, that, and the other thing. Custom importers\n\n  \nPresented by Brett Cannon\n\n  \nSince Python 2.3, the ability has existed to customize the import process so\nthat one can support code stored in alternative formats, e.g. zipimport and\nits support of importing code from a zip file. The aim of this talk is to make\nsure you understand how the custom import mechanism works and how to write\nyour own custom importers using importlib from Python 3.1.\n\n",
