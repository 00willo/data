  "description": "Interfaces, Adapters, and Factories\n\n  \nPresented by Jeff Rush\n\n  \nA step-by-step introduction to the idea of object interfaces and adapters\nusing incremental code examples, based on the zope.interface module. The case\nfor adaption to ease code brittleness will be made and how we can reason about\ninterfaces. I'll show how to automatically check code for conformance to your\ninterfaces and then cover where objects come from, the several kinds of object\nfactories in Python and how one kind can be based on interfaces.\n\n  \n[VIDEO HAS ISSUES: Beginning out of focus]\n\n",
