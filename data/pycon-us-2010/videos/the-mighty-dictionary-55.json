  "description": "The Mighty Dictionary\n\n  \nPresented by Brandon Craig Rhodes\n\n  \nBoth newcomers and experienced developers alike love Python's built-in data\ntypes \u00e2\u20ac\u201d especially dictionaries! But how do dictionaries work? What do they\ndo better than other container types, and where, on the other hand, are their\nweaknesses? Using simple, vivid diagrams that show the secrets of how the\ndictionary is implemented, and a series of progressively interesting examples\nof its behavior, we will train the Python developer's mind to picture what the\ndictionary is doing in just enough detail to make good decisions, as your data\nsets get larger, about when to use dictionaries and when other data structures\nmight be more appropriate.\n\n",
