  "description": "Optimizations and Micro-Optimizations in CPython\n\n  \nPresented by Mr. Larry Hastings\n\n  \nCPython mostly gets faster from one version to the next. And when CPython gets\nfaster, your programs get faster. This talk is a survey of optimizations made\nto CPython, recent and historical, large and small. Audience doesn't need to\nbe familiar with CPython internals, but should be familiar with Python and\nconversant in C.\n\n  \n[VIDEO HAS ISSUES: Audio interference]\n\n",
