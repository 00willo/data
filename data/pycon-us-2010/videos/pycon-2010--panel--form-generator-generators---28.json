  "description": "Panel: Form Generator Generators\n\n  \nChristopher Perkins; Brandon Craig Rhodes (Rhodes Mill Studios, Inc.); Chris P\nMcDonough (Agendaless Consulting); Jacob Kaplan-Moss (jacob@jacobian.org);\nJonathan Ellis\n\n  \nIt seems that almost every python web framework in existence has solved the\nproblem of automatically generating forms. Some have straight forward\ntechniques, some are unique or even an unusual approach to the problem. The\nquestion is: \"what can we learn from each other?\". This panel will examine the\ndifferent ways developers generate forms by offering examples, and summarizing\nthe functionality, differences, and similarities between these valuable web\ndevelopment tools.\n\n  \n[VIDEO HAS ISSUES: Feedback galore when moving between mics, cover your ears]\n\n",
