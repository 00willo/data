  "description": "Diversity as a Dependency\n\n  \nPresented by Anna M Ravenscroft (PSF)\n\n  \nThe PSF recently adopted a diversity statement. While some argue that we\nshould do this just because it's \"the right thing to do\", others question why\nwe, as a technical community, should even worry about diversity. This talk\naddresses the diversity question, not in moralistic or ethical terms, but in\npragmatic ones. Studies on creativity and productivity demonstrate the\npotential benefits of diversity for the Python community. Making Python the\nbest language it can be is not merely helped by increasing diversity, but may\nbe dependent on diversity.\n\n",
