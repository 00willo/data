  "description": "Hg and Git: Can't we all just get along?\n\nPresented by Scott Chacon\n\nThere is a fair amount of unnecessary animosity between developers about\nversion control systems, especially between Mercurial and Git users. In\nreality, these two systems are very similar and can actually cooperate pretty\nwell. In this talk we will show just how similar Git and Mercurial are, look\nat some of their technical differences, and see how they can work together by\nlooking at hg-git, the bidirectional Git/Mercurial bridge, implemented in\nPython.\n\n",
