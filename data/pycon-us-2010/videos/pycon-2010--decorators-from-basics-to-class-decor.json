  "description": "Decorators from Basics to Class Decorators to Decorator Libraries\n\nPresented by Charles Merriam\n\nDecorators simplify design and improve readability and reliability. This\ntutorial starts from the beginning with basic decorators, showing how\nsimple tasks like restricting administration functions are clearer and\nmore readable with decorators, and exactly how the decorators work. A\nsimple library of decorators for tracing, logging, and caching results\nis presented. This leads into writing your own decorators and\nparameterized decorators either from scratch or by using libraries like\nSimionato's Decorator Decorator and \"@call\\_before(fn)\". Finally, using\nPython 3.x class decorators in place of metaclasses for most common\ndictionary modifications is covered.\n\n[VIDEO HAS ISSUES: Missing about 1 minute at start, because of technical\nproblems.]\n",
