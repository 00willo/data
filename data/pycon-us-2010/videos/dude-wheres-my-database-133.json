Fortunately, Python can talk to\nvirtually all of them. With so many databases at our disposal, how do we\nchoose which one to use for our particular use case?\n\n  \nThis talk will go over the many different classes of databases, introduce some\nof the particular implementations for each class of database, and describe the\nstrengths and weaknesses of each. By weighing the pros and cons of each type\nof database, the speaker hopes to dispel the many rumors and misconceptions\nthat people have about what's out there today.\n\n  \n[VIDEO HAS ISSUES: Audio cuts out at about 20 seconds in, then gets out of\nsync until around 3:10.]\n\n", "video_mp4_url": "http://05d2db1380b6504cc981-8cbed8cf7e3a131cd8f1c3e383d10041.r93.cf2.rackcdn.com/pycon-us-2010/300_dude-where-s-my-database-133.m4v", "tags": ["databases", "pycon", "pycon2010"], "copyright_text": "Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 3.0", "related_urls": [], "video_flv_download_only": false, "source_url": "", "video_webm_url": "", "video_ogv_length": 188382147, "video_ogv_url": "http://05d2db1380b6504cc981-8cbed8cf7e3a131cd8f1c3e383d10041.r93.cf2.rackcdn.com/pycon-us-2010/300_dude-where-s-my-database-133.ogv", "language": "English", "video_webm_length": null, "summary": "", "thumbnail_url": "http://a.images.blip.tv/Pycon-PyCon2010DudeWheresMyDatabase133159.png", "video_flv_url": null}
