  "description": "Teaching compilers with python\n\nPresented by Dr. Matthieu Amiguet\n\nWhy choose Python to teach compilers?\n\nIn the University of Applied Sciences ARC, compilers are taught in a\nrelatively short amount of time. Focus is put on the main conceptual ideas,\nletting aside many technical details. Still, the students are expected to\nwrite a full compiler within a few weeks' time.\n\nAfter trying the traditional C/Lex/Yacc based approach, and a more education-\noriented Java/Jaccie solution, we settled on Python and PLY, plus a few\nenhancements (syntax tree graphical representation, decorator to achieve\nbetter code separation).\n\nAs a result, the students get a better understanding of the compiler concepts\nand produce more interesting and creative projects.\n\n",
