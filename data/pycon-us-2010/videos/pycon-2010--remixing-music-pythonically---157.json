Lindsay\n\nThe Echo Nest Remix API ([http://code.google.com/p/echo-nest-\nremix/](http://code.google.com/p/echo-nest-remix/)) was made open source by\nThe Echo Nest, a \"music intelligence\" company based in the Boston area in the\nautumn of 2008. This talk will offer details on the concise expressivity\noffered when editing multimedia driven by content-based features, and some\ninsights on what Pythonic magic did and didn't work in the development of the\nmodules. Audio and video examples of the fun-yet-odd outputs that are possible\nwill be shown.\n\n",
