  "description": "Extending Java Applications with Jython\n\n  \nPresented by Frank J Wierzbicki (Jython)\n\n  \nJython is an implementation of Python for the JVM. This talk covers the\noptions available for integrating Jython and Java code, especially Java\ncalling into Jython, since this is the trickier case. This talk will also\ncover some Java specific deployment options, such as deploying your Jython\napplication as a jar file. Jar files allow you to package Java/Jython\napplications into a single archive. In many environments a user can click on a\njar file to launch the contained application.\n\n",
