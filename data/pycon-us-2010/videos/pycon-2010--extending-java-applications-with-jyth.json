  "description": "Extending Java Applications with Jython\n\nPresented by Frank J Wierzbicki (Jython)\n\nJython is an implementation of Python for the JVM. This talk covers the\noptions available for integrating Jython and Java code, especially Java\ncalling into Jython, since this is the trickier case. This talk will\nalso cover some Java specific deployment options, such as deploying your\nJython application as a jar file. Jar files allow you to package\nJava/Jython applications into a single archive. In many environments a\nuser can click on a jar file to launch the contained application.\n",
