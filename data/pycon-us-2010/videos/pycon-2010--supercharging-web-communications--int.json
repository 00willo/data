  "description": "Supercharging Web Communications: Integrating Python-based Apps with\nSalesforce.com CRM\n\n  \nPresented by Christopher Johnson\n\n  \nSalesforce.com is a leading provider of Customer Relationship Management (CRM)\nfor enterprises (over 55,000 customers) and nonprofits (over 6,000 customers).\nWhile it handles sales, marketing and support processes, it can be extended to\nautomate any business process, making it a core part of business operations.\nPython developers working with companies using salesforce.com need to be able\nto integrate applications with Salesforce. Luckily, Salesforce.com has an\nelegant and powerful SOAP API. This presentation will introduce an example of\nusing the Python wrapper for the Salesforce.com API (Beatbox) in an\ninteractive website. While the library itself is powerful and can be used in\ncustom Python applications, the Python community can also leverage the\nadvanced integration between the Plone Content Management System (CMS) and\nsalesforce.com. We will demonstrate how a Plone website can post forms,\necommerce transactions, and event RSVPs to salesforce. Additionally, we will\nshow how developers can make Salesforce.com data interactive in a Plone\nwebsite.\n\n",
