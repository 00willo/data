  "description": "The Meaty Parts of Python: Closures, Decorators, List Comprehension, and\nFunctional Constructs\n\nPresented by Matt Harrison\n\nAre you new to Python and want to learn how to step it up to the next level?\nHave you wondered about functional programming, closures, decorators,\ngenerators or list comprehensions and when you should use them? This hands-on\ntutorial will cover these intermediate subjects in detail, by explaining the\ntheory behind them then walking through examples. It will also cover how to\ntest such programs. The session will conclude with some basic problems to work\nthrough.\n\nOutline:\n\n  * Testing (45 min) \n    * unittest \n    * doctest \n    * brief code coverage intro \n    * other testing tools \n  * Functional Programming (15 min) \n    * lambda \n    * map \n    * reduce \n    * filter \n    * Substitutes for above constructs \n  * Functions (20 min) \n    * callables \n    * arguments (args, kw) \n    * mutable parameters \n  * Scoping (10 min) \n  * Closures (5 min) \n  * Decorators (20 min) \n    * Simple decorators \n    * parameterized decorators \n    * mangling \n    * templates for decorators \n    * classmethod staticmethod \n  * Properties (5 min) \n  * List comprehensions (10 min) \n  * Iterator pattern (5 min) \n  * Generators (15 min ) \n  * Hands-on application (50 min) \n\n",
