Almost\nten years later, Web developers are still confused as to how to apply the REST\nprinciples in their applications. Examples of poorly designed 'REST' APIs\nabound, and I will make use of them in my talk.\n\n  \nIn this presentation, I will give an overview of REST and its design\nprinciples, and I will show a concrete example of a RESTful Web service\nimplemented in the restish framework. My examples will include CRUD\noperations, as well as transactions. I will also show how to consume this Web\nservice using both httplib2 and curl. I would be remiss if I didn't describe\nways to test the Web service with WebTest and twill.\n\n", "video_mp4_url": "http://05d2db1380b6504cc981-8cbed8cf7e3a131cd8f1c3e383d10041.r93.cf2.rackcdn.com/pycon-us-2010/301_creating-restful-web-services-with-restish-17.m4v", "tags": ["pycon", "pycon2010", "rest", "restish", "testing", "web"], "copyright_text": "Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 3.0", "related_urls": [], "video_flv_download_only": false, "source_url": "", "video_webm_url": null, "video_ogv_length": 506397358, "video_ogv_url": "http://05d2db1380b6504cc981-8cbed8cf7e3a131cd8f1c3e383d10041.r93.cf2.rackcdn.com/pycon-us-2010/301_creating-restful-web-services-with-restish-17.ogv", "language": "English", "video_webm_length": null, "summary": "", "thumbnail_url": "http://a.images.blip.tv/Pycon-PyCon2010CreatingRESTfulWebServicesWithRestish17893.png", "video_flv_url": null}
