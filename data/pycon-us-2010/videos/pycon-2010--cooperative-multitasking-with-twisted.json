  "description": "Cooperative Multitasking with Twisted: Getting Things Done Concurrently\n\n  \nPresented by David A Reid\n\n  \nTwisted is a framework for building asynchronous networking applications. It\nalso provides powerful tools for writing non-blocking non-network code, tools\nwhich are vital for building real large scale applications in Twisted. I hope\nto give a comprehensive overview of these tools to help the intermediate\nTwisted user get things done concurrently.\n\n  \n[VIDEO HAS ISSUES: Picture out of focus at the beginning]\n\n",
