  "description": "Ecommerce in Python: Introduction to Satchmo and GetPaid\n\n  \nPresented by Christopher Johnson (ifPeople); Chris Moffitt (Satchmo)\n\n  \nThe world of open source ecommerce is dominated by PHP-based solutions.\nHowever, in the past few years, there has been significant progress in\nbuilding robust python-based alternatives. This discussion will cover 2\ndifferent python approaches. Satchmo is based on the Django framework and\nGetPaid is a framework for credit card processing in Plone. These solutions\nshare a similar philosophy and approach but can be used in very different\nways. This discussion will increase awareness of these applications, feature\nsuccessful projects, explain how they can be used in your projects, and help\nyou connect with the open source community.\n\n",
