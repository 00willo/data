  "summary": "A lot of people have heard of Jython, some have tried it, but it seems few have actually deployed it in a corporate environment. In this talk I'll share my experiences in using Jython as a testbed for Java applications, for rapid prototyping in Java desktop and web environments, and for embedding scripting capabilities in Java products.", 
  "description": "Not everyone gets paid to work with Python all the time, but if you find yourself in a Java project, there are good chances you could benefit from Python without throwing out the Java stack. Using Jython, you can do rapid prototyping without the long edit-compile-test cycles normally associated with large Java projects, whether on the web or the desktop, and when testing an application might become a nightmare of scaffolding in Java, a little Jython may be just what you need to be able to run your tests smoothly.\r\n\r\nAt the end of this talk, I will put on my politician\u00b4s hat and bring up the best - and worst - arguments to use to get permission to use Jython in a corporate environment.
