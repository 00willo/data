Using Jython, you can do rapid prototyping without the long edit-compile-test cycles normally associated with large Java projects, whether on the web or the desktop, and when testing an application might become a nightmare of scaffolding in Java, a little Jython may be just what you need to be able to run your tests smoothly.\r\n\r\nAt the end of this talk, I will put on my politician\u00b4s hat and bring up the best - and worst - arguments to use to get permission to use Jython in a corporate environment.
