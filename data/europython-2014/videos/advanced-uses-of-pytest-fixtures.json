  "summary": "One unique and powerful feature of py.test is the dependency injection\nof test fixtures using function arguments. This talk aims to walk\nthrough py.test's fixture mechanism gradually introducing more complex\nuses and features. This should lead to an understanding of the power of\nthe fixture system and how to build complex but easily-managed test\nsuites using them.\n",
  "description": "This talks will assume some basic familiarity with the py.test testing\nframework and explore only the fixture mechanism. It will build up more\ncomplex examples which will lead up to touching on other plugin features\nof py.test. It is expected people will be familiar with python features\nlike functions as first-class objects, closures etc.\n",
