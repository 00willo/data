  "title": "RISCy Business: Development of a RNAi design and off-target prediction software",
  "summary": "RNA interference (RNAi) is a biological mechanism for targeted\ninhibition of gene expression. It has also been used routinely to\ndiscover genes involved in the interaction of plants with pathogenic\nfungi. To minimize the miss-targeting of unrelated genes and to maximize\nthe RNAi efficiency, we have developed a PyQt based cross- platform\nsoftware tool called \u201csi-Fi\u201d. Our aim of the talk is to show that also\nhobby programmers can use Python in a very useful way.\n",
