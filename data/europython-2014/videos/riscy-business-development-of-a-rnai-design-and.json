  "title": "RISCy Business: Development of a RNAi design and off-target prediction software", 
  "summary": "RNA interference (RNAi) is a biological mechanism for targeted inhibition of gene expression. It has also been used routinely to discover genes involved in the interaction of plants with pathogenic fungi. To minimize the miss-targeting of unrelated genes and to maximize the RNAi efficiency, we have developed a PyQt based cross- platform software tool called \u201csi-Fi\u201d. Our aim of the talk is to show that also hobby programmers can use Python in a very useful way.",
