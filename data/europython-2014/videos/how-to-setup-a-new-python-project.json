  "summary": "Setting up a new Python project from scratch can be quite hard. How to structure your files and directories. Where should my packages, modules, documentation and unit tests go? How do I configure setup.py, Sphinx and so on? We provide proven answers!", 
  "description": "Whenever a Python beginner starts with its own project he or she is confronted with the same technical questions. Questions about a well thought out directory structure to hold all the files. How setup.py needs to be configured and even what it is capable of like specifying entry_points and other goodies. We show from the experience of our yearslong work with Python how to structure your Python project in terms of folders, files, modules and packages. How to configure setup.py to specify your requirements, to use it with nosetests, with Sphinx and so on. We also elaborate on the usage of Git and Versioneer (https://github.com/warner/python-versioneer) to help you version your package.",
