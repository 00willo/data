  "summary": "There has been a lot of noise about being a \"full stack developer\"\nrecently. What does the full web stack look like for Python and how do\nyou go about learning each piece?\n\nThis talk will guide you up the layers from the server that handles the\nweb request through the JavaScript that executes on a user's browser.\n",
  "description": "This talk distills information from the open source guide `Full Stack\nPython <http://www.fullstackpython.com/>`__ I wrote into a 30 minute\ntalk on web stack layers. An approximate timeline for this talk would\nbe:\n\n-  5 min: intro story\n-  5 min: what the web developers need to know about virtual servers,\n   web servers, and WSGI servers\n-  5 min: what do web frameworks provide?\n-  5 min: what are the most important parts of your web application to\n   analyze and monitor?\n-  5 min: static files and execution on the user's browser\n-  5 min: concluding story and resources to learn more\n\nThis is a high level overview intended for developers who are new to\nPython web development and need to understand what the web stack layers\nare and how they fit together.\n",
