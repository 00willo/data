However, when processing large amounts of data, in particular in combination with GUI toolkits (*Qt*) or three-dimensional visualizations (*OpenGL*), it seems that Python as an interpretative programming language may be reaching its limits.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n*Outline*\r\n\r\n- Introduction (1 min)\r\n    - motivation\r\n- GR framework (2 mins)\r\n    - layer structure\r\n    - output devices and capabilities\r\n- GR3 framework (1 min)\r\n    - layer structure\r\n    - output capabilities (3 mins)\r\n        - high-resolution images\r\n        - POV-Ray scenes\r\n        - OpenGL drawables\r\n        - HTML5 / WebGL\r\n- Simple 2D / 3D examples (2 min)\r\n- Interoperability (PyQt/PySide, 3 min)\r\n- How to speed up Python scripts (4 mins)\r\n    - Numpy\r\n    - Numba (Pro) \r\n- Animated visualization examples (live demos, 6 mins)\r\n    - physics simulations\r\n    - surfaces / meshes\r\n    - molecule viewer\r\n    - MRI voxel data\r\n- Outlook (1 min)\r\n\r\n*Notes*\r\n\r\nLinks to similar talks, tutorials or presentations can be found [here][1].
