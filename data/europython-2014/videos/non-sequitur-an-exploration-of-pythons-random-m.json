  "summary": "An exploration of Python's random module for the curious programmer,\nthis talk will give a little background in statistics and pseudorandom\nnumber generation, explain the properties of python's choice of\npseudorandom generator and explore through visualizations the different\ndistributions provided by the module.\n",
  "description": "Audience\n========\n\nNon mathematical people who wants a better understanding of Python's\nrandom module.\n\nObjectives\n==========\n\nThe audience will understand pseudorandom number generators, the\nproperties of Python's Mersenne Twister and the differences and possible\nuse cases between the distributions provided by the ``random`` module.\n\nThe talk\n========\n\nI will start by talking about what randomness means and then about how\nwe try to achieve it in computing through pseudorandom number generators\n(5 min.)\n\nI will give a brief overview of pseudorandom number generation\ntechniques, show how their quality can be assessed and finally talk\nabout Python's Mersenne Twister and why it is a fairly good choice. (10\nmin.)\n\nFinally I will talk about how from randomness we can build generators\nwith interesting probability distributions. I'll compare through\nvisualizations thos provided in Python's ``random`` module and show\nexamples of when they can be useful in real-life. (10 min.)\n",
