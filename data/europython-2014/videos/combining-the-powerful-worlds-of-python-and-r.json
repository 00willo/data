  "summary": "Although maybe not very well known in the Python community there exists\na powerful statistical open-source ecosystem called R. Mostly used in\nscientific contexts it provides lots of functionality for doing\nstatistical analysis, generation of various kinds of plots and graphs,\nand much, much more.\n\nThe triplet `R <http://www.r-project.org>`__,\n`Rserve <https://rforge.net/Rserve/>`__, and\n`pyRserve <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pyRserve/>`__ allows the\nbuilding up of a network bridge from Python to R: Now R-functions can be\ncalled from Python as if they were implemented in Python, and even\ncomplete R scripts can be executed through this connection.\n",
  "description": "pyRserve is a small open source project originally developed to fulfill\nthe needs of a German biotech company to do statistical analysis in a\nlarge Python-based Lab Information Management System (LIMS). In contrast\nto other R-related libraries like RPy where Python and R run on the same\nhost, pyRserve allows the distribution of complex operations and\ncalculations over multiple R servers across the network.\n\nThe aim of this talk is to show how easily Python can be connected to R,\nand to present a number of selected (simple) code examples which\ndemonstrate the power of this setup.\n",
