  "description": "Python has been used in educational programmes ever since. With a\nbandwidth that large, navigating the landscape of Python tutorials is\nhard indeed.\n\nThis talk will look at successful Python teaching material. From the\nnumerous iterations our material has gone through, we draw conclusions\non what's crucial in teaching Python. It will introduce how the\nOpenTechSchool is teaching Python and what measures it found most\neffective in spreading programming in general and Python in particular.\nAmong these are rapid feedback, supervised learning, localization, and\nknowing your target audience.\n\nThe author is a member of the OpenTechSchool, a free community\ninitiative which offers Python workshop on a number of topics. Some of\nthe workshops have been running for more than two years now. He has\nwritten the first versions of \"Python for beginners,\" a workshop which\nhas been used in many cities to teach Python to programming novices.\n",
