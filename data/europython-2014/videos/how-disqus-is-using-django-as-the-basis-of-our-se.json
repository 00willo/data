  "summary": "Disqus maintains the largest Django app out there. And we love it! It has, however, grown rather large and unwieldy. In the last year Disqus has had an increasing number of smaller services cropping up based on several different platforms. So this talk will be about how we do continuous deployment with our emerging service-based infrastructure.",
