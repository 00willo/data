  "title": "Jigna: a seamless Python-JS bridge to create rich HTML UIs for Python apps", 
  "summary": "Jigna aims to provide an easy way to create rich user interfaces for Python applications using web technologies like HTML, CSS and Javascript, as opposed to widget based toolkits like Qt/wx or native toolkits. It provides a seamless two-way data binding between the Python model and the HTML view by creating a Python-JS communication bridge. This ensures that the view is always live as it can automatically update itself when the model changes, and update the model when user actions take place on the UI. The Jigna view can be rendered in an in-process Qt widget or over the web in a browser.",
