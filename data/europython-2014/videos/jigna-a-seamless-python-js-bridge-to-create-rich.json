  "alias": "video/3027/jigna-a-seamless-python-js-bridge-to-create-rich",
  "summary": "Jigna aims to provide an easy way to create rich user interfaces for\nPython applications using web technologies like HTML, CSS and\nJavascript, as opposed to widget based toolkits like Qt/wx or native\ntoolkits. It provides a seamless two-way data binding between the Python\nmodel and the HTML view by creating a Python-JS communication bridge.\nThis ensures that the view is always live as it can automatically update\nitself when the model changes, and update the model when user actions\ntake place on the UI. The Jigna view can be rendered in an in-process Qt\nwidget or over the web in a browser.\n",
