  "summary": "Do want to test the connection code to a wifi/gsm network, but you haven't any dongle? Do you want to check your software notification when the battery is low, but you're testing your application on your desktop? Do you want to manipulate the data coming from a device, but you've lend it to someone else? *No problem, you can emulate all these with Python!*", 
  "description": "With the kernel [inotify](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inotify \"inotify\") feature, the [D-Bus mocker library](https://launchpad.net/python-dbusmock \"D-Bus mocker library\") and the [udev monitoring](http://pyudev.readthedocs.org/en/latest/api/pyudev.html#pyudev.Monitor \"udev monitoring\") we try to detect the different events that occours when you're using a specific set of connected devices.\r\n\r\nThen we try to mimic these devices investigating also the kernel drivers if necessary.\r\n\r\nAt the end we're ready to connect the simulation routines to our testing procedure.",
