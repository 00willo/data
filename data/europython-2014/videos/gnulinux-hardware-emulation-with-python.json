  "summary": "Do want to test the connection code to a wifi/gsm network, but you\nhaven't any dongle? Do you want to check your software notification when\nthe battery is low, but you're testing your application on your desktop?\nDo you want to manipulate the data coming from a device, but you've lend\nit to someone else? *No problem, you can emulate all these with Python!*\n",
  "description": "With the kernel `inotify <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inotify>`__\nfeature, the `D-Bus mocker\nlibrary <https://launchpad.net/python-dbusmock>`__ and the `udev\nmonitoring <http://pyudev.readthedocs.org/en/latest/api/pyudev.html#pyudev.Monitor>`__\nwe try to detect the different events that occours when you're using a\nspecific set of connected devices.\n\nThen we try to mimic these devices investigating also the kernel drivers\nif necessary.\n\nAt the end we're ready to connect the simulation routines to our testing\nprocedure.\n",
