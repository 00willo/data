  "summary": "This talk discusses good ways to organise packaging and testing for\nPython projects. It walks through a per-company and an open source\nscenario and explains how to best use the \"devpi-server\" and \"tox\" for\nmaking sure you are delivering good and well tested and documented\npackages. As time permits, we also discuss in-development features such\nas real-time mirroring and search.\n",
