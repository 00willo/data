  "summary": "This talk discusses good ways to organise packaging and testing\r\nfor Python projects.  It walks through a per-company and an\r\nopen source scenario and explains how to best use the\r\n\"devpi-server\" and \"tox\" for making sure you are delivering\r\ngood and well tested and documented packages.  As time permits, we also\r\ndiscuss in-development features such as real-time mirroring and\r\nsearch.", 
  "description": "The talk discusses the following tools:\r\n\r\n- devpi-server for running an in-house or per-laptop python package server\r\n\r\n- inheritance between package indexes and from pypi.python.org public packages\r\n\r\n- the \"devpi\" client tool for uploading docs and running tests \r\n\r\n- running of tests through tox \r\n\r\n- summary view with two work flows: open source releases and in-house per-company developments \r\n\r\n- roadmap and in-development features of devpi and tox \r\n\r\n(The presenter is the main author of the tools in question).
