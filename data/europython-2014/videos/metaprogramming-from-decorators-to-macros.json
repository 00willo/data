  "description": "This talk is a journey in the wonderful world of metaprogramming. We\nstart off with the meaning of metaprogramming and what it can be used\nfor.\n\nThen we look at what can be done in Python, introducing function and\nclass decorators. When decorators are not enough anymore we move to the\nblack magic of metaclasses, showing how we can implemement a simple\nDjango-like model with them.\n\nIn the bonus track we'll talk about macros, as the ultimate\nmetaprogramming weapon, showing briefly how Lisp macros work and\nintroducing the amazing `macropy\nlibrary <https://github.com/lihaoyi/macropy>`__.\n",
