  "summary": "PythonAnywhere hosts tens of thousands of Python web applications, with\ntraffic ranging from a couple of hits a week to dozens of hits a second.\nHosting this many sites reliably at a reasonable cost requires a\nwell-designed infrastructure, but it uses the same standard components\nas many other Python-based websites. We've built our stack on GNU/Linux,\nnginx, uWSGI, Redis, and Lua -- all managed with Python. In this talk\nwe'll give a high-level overview of how it all works, by tracing how a\nrequest goes from the browser to the Python application and its response\ngoes back again. As well as showing how a fairly large deployment works,\nwe'll give tips on scaling and share a few insights that may help people\nrunning smaller sites discover how they can speed things up.\n",
