  "description": "Pinax after three years: Lessons learnt and the way forward\n\nPresented by James Tauber\n\nThe Pinax platform has had its ups and downs since it was launched in 2008.\nPeople either love it or just don't get it. About the only thing everyone\nagrees on is that it doesn't seem to be progressing as fast as it once did.\nThis talk will take a fresh look at the goals of Pinax, what we did well, what\nwe didn't do so well and what we're (slowly) doing to fix it.\n\n",
