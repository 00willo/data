  "description": "Testing: The Developer Strikes Back\n\nSandy Strong\n\n\u201cCode not tested is broken by design\u201d - Jacob Kaplan-Moss\n\nEvery programming project has unique testing needs. It\u2019s not always easy to\nunderstand what those needs are, or how to write tests that satisfy them. One\nof our goals as developers is to write tests that minimize failures in\nproduction that can cost our companies time, money, resources, and in many\ncases, hours of sleep!\n\n",
