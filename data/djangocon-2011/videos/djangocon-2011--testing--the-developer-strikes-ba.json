  "description": "Testing: The Developer Strikes Back\n\nSandy Strong\n\n\u201cCode not tested is broken by design\u201d - Jacob Kaplan-Moss\n\nEvery programming project has unique testing needs. It\u2019s not always easy\nto understand what those needs are, or how to write tests that satisfy\nthem. One of our goals as developers is to write tests that minimize\nfailures in production that can cost our companies time, money,\nresources, and in many cases, hours of sleep!\n",
