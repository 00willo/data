  "summary": "", 
  "description": "Groups that are more diverse are [better at solving problems](https://www.google.com/#q=diverse+%22problem+solving%22) than more homogenous groups. An inclusive group culture maximizes the odds of attracting and retaining skills & personalities needed to thrive. The Python community has a pretty good track record on issues related to inclusion. So, how can you help continue that trend, especially in your local community? I'll start with a brief *WHY*  and *WHAT* of  Inclusion, but most of this talk focuses on **HOW** to help your local corner of the Python community be as Inclusive as possible.",
