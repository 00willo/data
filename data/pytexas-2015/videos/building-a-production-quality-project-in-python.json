  "summary": "", 
  "description": "This presentation focuses on a variety of tools which can help Python developers rapidly create production worthy projects by drawing on my own experience in creating and deploying a Python project called Arsenal at Rackspace in the space of a few months.\n\nArsenal is an open-source service designed to manage and direct a cache of operating system images on bare-metal nodes. The goal being to drastically reduce the time it takes to provision a node for end-users/customers of a bare-metal cloud. \n\nLinks to information about arsenal:\nhttps://github.com/rackerlabs/arsenal https://arsenal.readthedocs.org/en/latest/",
