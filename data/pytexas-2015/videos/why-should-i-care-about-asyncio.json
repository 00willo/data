  "description": "Python 3.3 added `yield from` and 3.4 added [`asyncio`][]. Python 3.5 adds `async` and `await` from [PEP 492][]. What is all this stuff? Why do we need new syntax? And why should I care?\n\nThis talk is about why async programming is worth caring about and why Python's approach has me so excited.\n\n[`asyncio`]: https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio.html\n[PEP 492]: https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0492/",
