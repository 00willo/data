  "description": "Becoming an expert in network security is difficult and time-consuming, putting it beyond the reach of the average web developer. However, addition of just a few lines of code to a django project using the django-secure package can pre-emptively pick much of an attackers low-hanging fruit. In this meetup, we will secure a simple website using django-secure, use the command-line tool \"checksecure\" to do a security audit, and discuss a few of the attacks django-secure protects against. In the process, we will learn how to use nginx for more robust security and discuss how to pass a security audit.",
