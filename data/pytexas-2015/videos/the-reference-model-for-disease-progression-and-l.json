  "description": "The Reference Model for Disease progression is a league of disease models that determines fitness of publicly available populations and models and assumptions. \nThe Reference Model has grown to the point that it was hard to maintain the code base and increase the number of populations. Recent advances with the MIcro Simulation Tool (MIST), that runs the model, allow object oriented population generation. Evolutionary Computation, using the Python Inspyred library by Aaron Garrett, is a key element in MIST population generation. Recent developments allow easier introductions of variations in population generation to figure out fitness of unknown base assumptions. This is powerful in conjunction with High Performance Computing that allows testing multiple modeling assumptions in parallel.  \nPrevious work was presented in this and other venues: \n* https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyvxiljc5vA \n* http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AD896WakR94",
