  "summary": "", 
  "description": "In this talk I will discuss the challenges with traditional network routing and how they are being simplified with software defined networking (SDN) and Open vSwitch (OVS).  I will introduce a python framework called ryu that allows a developer to easily customize and extend OVS to route network traffic based on their needs.  I will demo a few different topologies and show the code that allows use to customize routes.  Finally I will discuss how we at Rackspace are using this framework to solve some extremely complex issues.",
