  "summary": "", 
  "description": "Many Python developers came to the language because of its elegance and styling. However, we all have a different sense of style and often waste time in code reviews arguing over different ways to format our code. This talk will introduce you to a new tool called YAPF which takes a slightly different approach than other tools like autopep8 and pep8ify. We'll talk about what is different about YAPF and why its approach is better suited to make us more happy and efficient developers. The talk will also showcase some examples of YAPF in everyday use.",
