  "description": "Mezzanine is a very capable content management system built upon a django foundation, but it is not widely known. While built with developers in mind, it has some great features for users. You can get a basic site going with a few static pages and a blog in relatively short order. When you're ready, you can extend it to do whatever you like! There are add-on projects Cartridge, a shopping cart; and Drum, a Hacker News/Reddit type site.\r\n\r\nWe'll cover:\r\n\r\n +  How to get started (\"Mezzanine is just django\")\r\n +  Why it is a django project and not an app\r\n +  Customizing with templates\r\n +  The django page model\r\n +  Cartridge and Drum\r\n +  Integrating your own apps\r\n +  more!\r\n\r\n[ This can be made a short talk if that would fit better ]",
