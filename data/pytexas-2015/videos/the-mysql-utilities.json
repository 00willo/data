  "description": "MySQL Utilities is both a set of command-line utilities as well as a Python library for making the common tasks easy to accomplish. The library is written entirely in Python, meaning that it is not necessary to have any other tools or libraries installed to make it work.  There are twenty eight utilites that do everything from copying databases to setting up replilcation with automatic failover in case the master server fails.",
