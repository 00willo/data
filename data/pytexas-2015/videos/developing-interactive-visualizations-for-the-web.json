  "description": "As a materials researcher, I was interested in developing dashboards to interface with lab instruments and make interactive visualizations to communicate research results. However, I always felt that my rudimentary JavaScript skills were holding me back. A new python library, Bokeh, provides a clean, simple way to make visualizations that are intended for the web while writing none or minimal JavaScript.\n\nIn this talk, I\u2019ll discuss building interactive visualizations using Bokeh and embedding them within a Flask application.",
