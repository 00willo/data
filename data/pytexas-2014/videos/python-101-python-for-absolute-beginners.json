  "summary": "", 
  "description": "If you're absolutely new to Python, and to programming in general, this is the place to start!  \r\n\r\nHere's the breakdown: by the end of this workshop, you'll have Python downloaded onto your personal machine; have a general idea of what Python can help you do; be pointed in the direction of some excellent practice materials; and have a basic understanding of the syntax of the language. \r\n\r\nPlease don't forget to bring your laptop!\r\n\r\nAudience:\r\n\"Python 101\" is geared toward individuals who are new to programming. If you've had some programming experience (shell scripting, MATLAB, Ruby, etc.), then you'll probably want to check out the more intermediate workshop, \"Python 101++\".",
