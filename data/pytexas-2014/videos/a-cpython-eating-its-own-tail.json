  "summary": "", 
  "description": "This is an expert-level talk that dives into CPython and discusses various ways to embed Python interpreters. It starts with the \"very high level\" embedding & the \"pure\" embedding, shows a fairly novel \"zero interpreter\" embedding using Cython, a few attempts at a ctypes/cffi embedding, and builds to a finish with a source-filter embedding of a Python interpreter into itself.\u00a0\r\n\r\nThe purpose of this talk is to have some fun diving into CPython internals while looking practical approaches to embedding CPython interpreters into other (C/C++) processes. The final result, a Python 3 interpreter embedded into a Python 2 interpreter as an extension model, is novel but may be of fairly limited actual use. It is, however, pretty wild and a lot of fun!",
