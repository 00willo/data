  "description": "At PyTexas 2013 I gave a talk on using Python to work with spreadsheets. The landscape is rapidly changing and the options have expanded. This talk will be a whirlwind tour of your options for using Python with spreadsheets (NOT just Excel) as of late 2014. From processing spreadsheet *files* to using Python to directly control a spreadsheet app, we'll see what's available, with a focus on how it can help **you** with what you work on.",
