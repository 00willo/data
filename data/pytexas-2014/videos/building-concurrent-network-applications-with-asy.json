  "description": "In this talk, I'll introduce the `asyncio` module, which was recently added to the Python standard library. I'll talk about the problems that can be solved with asynchronous I/O and will show how the tools provided by the module, including event loops, coroutines, and futures, along with Python's new `yield from` syntax, can be used to build a concurrent network application.",
