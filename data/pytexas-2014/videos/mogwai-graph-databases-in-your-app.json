  "summary": "", 
  "description": "Graph Databases can be very powerful when used correctly, unfortunately the landscape is still very young, let alone finding a python library to interface with your database.  Here we will cover Titan (a highly scalable graph database) and Mogwai (a python OGM, maintained by me) to interface with the database in an intuitive and easy fashion. \r\n\r\nWe'll very quickly cover the concept of graph databases, and interacting with Titan via the Gremlin REPL. Following that we'll go headstrong into working with Mogwai and create a simple web API.\r\n\r\nhttp://mogwai.readthedocs.org/\r\nhttp://bitbucket.org/wellaware/mogwai",
