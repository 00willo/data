  "summary": "", 
  "description": "The Python community needs many different types of contributions to thrive. If you ever thought, \"I'm not a great programmer, so I can't contribute to the Python community. :-(\", you're WRONG!\r\n\r\nFirst, using classes and roles from Dungeons & Dragons (D&D) as a lens, we'll  look at multiple contributing roles in the Python community, and how you can find one that fits you. Not familiar with D&D? I'll provide a brief, relevant primer.\r\n\r\nNext, we'll continue the discussion to see how Inclusiveness helps us get those different contributors into the Python community. To use D&D language, a party of only one class won't go far. We'll also look at how Inclusiveness is NOT the same thing as Diversity or Political Correctness.",
