  "summary": "", 
  "description": "Quantum GIS (QGIS) is an open-source, highly customizable geospatial application that's great for data exploration, manipulation, and cartographic preparation -- in other words, it's software that allows you to make detailed, aesthetically-pleasing maps for free!\r\n\r\nQGIS is also *extremely* script-able with Python, and integrates with a large number of database and analysis backends (GRASS, R, PostGIS, etc.). In this talk, Paige Bailey will be giving a short overview of QGIS; detailing a few mapping case studies; then showing how to leverage additional functionality by writing custom Python plugins.",
