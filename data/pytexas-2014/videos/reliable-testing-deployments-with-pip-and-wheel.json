  "description": "I plan to briefly introduce pip requirements files and the wheel format.  I will then demonstrate an approach for structuring requirements files, using \"snapshot\" requirement files, and building \"wheelhouses\" that get committed to your VCS.  This approach has the following benefits:\r\n\r\n- known working & tested dependencies are clearly communicated between developers\r\n- project setup for new developers is simplified\r\n- build servers no longer throw erroneous errors if PyPI is down\r\n- production environments no longer need build tools installed on them\r\n- production environments are guaranteed to be running on the same version of dependencies that were developed on and tested",
