  "description": "I\u2019m interested in giving a talk for this conference as I believe many\nstudents with the same background as mine would be interested in hearing\nabout how Data Science is a crucial tool in building a successful\nstartup and its influence on taking decision every day. As part of my\nwork I use python and scientific librairies ( pandas, scikit\u00adlearn) on a\ndaily basis as it is used both on our backend services as well as for\nData analysis. We tackle complex problems such as Dynamic Pricing\ndepending on local demand an supply, dispatching Drivers efficiently,\nMatching multiple passenger routes together for or real time\nride\u00adsharing product Lyft Line, real\u00adtime ETAs and traffic estimation\u2026\nThe fact that a lot of or analyses use geolocation data adds a specific\ncomponent to it that leads to complex problems. Optimization is crucial\nas it is beneficial for everyone in our Marketplace: Passenger can get\nlower prices and better service, Drivers spend more time with someone in\ntheir car and have higher earnings\u2026\n",
