  "summary": "",
  "description": "This talk will be a general introduction to Numba. Numba is a\njust\u00ad-in-\u00adtime Python compiler that allows you to speed up numerical\nalgorithms for which fast linear algebra (i.e. Numpy array operations)\nis not enough. It has backends for the CPU and for CUDA GPUs.\n\n::\n\n    Expected audience: Python programmers / scientists who have an interest in speeding up numerical routines. Also, people who are curious about attempts at high-\u00adperformance Python.\n\n",
