  "description": "Project Management 101\n\nPresented by James Bonanno\n\nPython is employed for a general purpose project management tool. Contrasted\nto tools like Sphinx which focus on documenting a software project, this\nframework is intended for general purpose project management, with a specific\napplication into engineering projects. Intermediate uses of Python are\nemployed, as well as the Web.py framework, Sphinx documentation tool and the\nMako template system. The author has used this tool to create internal\ncommercial applications of the project management software.\n\n[VIDEO HAS ISSUES: Technical issues at beginning (first talk of conference,\ngear wasn't quite setup); missing initial section of talk, then missing 20\nseconds about 3 minutes in.\n\n",
