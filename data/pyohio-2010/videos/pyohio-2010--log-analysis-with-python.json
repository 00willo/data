  "description": "Log Analysis with Python\n\nPresented by Scott McCarty\n\nLog analysis is something that every programmer and systems adminstrator must\ndo sometimes. This talk will be an introduction to the concepts of pattern\nrecognition, artificial ignorance, word counting, stopword lists, and command\nline graphing. It is based on a pythonic implementation of these techniques\ncalled petit and will delve into several use cases and show how using these\ntechniques can help you save time when analyzing logs with python.\n\n",
