  "description": "Controlling UNIX Processes using Supervisor\n\nPresented by Calvin Hendryx-Parker\n\nSupervisor is a Python daemon that can control arbitrary processes in a UNIX-\nlike environment. It features a client/server model of control that can easily\nbe extended. This talk will cover the configuration and setup of Supervisor.\nIt will also cover how to extend Supervisor and take advantage of its XML-RPC\ninterface and ability to react to events that it generates.\n\n",
