  "description": "In Python, we're trying to solve packaging problems in our own domain, but maybe someone else already solved most our problems. \r\n\r\nIn the talk I'll show how I develop and deploy Python projects that can be easily mixed with non-Python dependencies. \r\n\r\nhttp://nixos.org/nix/ will be demonstrated to replace technologies in our stack: pip, virtualenv, buildout, ansible, jenkins.",
