  "description": "Creating Web APIs that are a joy to use\n\nPresented by Issac Kelly\n\nIssac is an avid API consumer. He&aposll cover how to make an API that is not\nterrible. This is apparently very difficult to do, and many anti-patterns will\nbe shown. No care will be taken to protect the guilty. This talk is not as\nfocused on Python, as it is on creating Web APIs, and an understanding of HTTP\nis assumed.\n\n",
