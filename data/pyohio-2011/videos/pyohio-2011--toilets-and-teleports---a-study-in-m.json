  "description": "Toilets and Teleports - A study in Model-View-Control (MVC)\n\nPresented by Howard Mooneyham\n\nHave you ever wondered how to create a Model View Control program? Come to my\ntalk and we will go through building a simple MVC program, Toilets and\nTeleports. We will then use one of the benefits of MVC to replace the View\nwith a production quality version with GUI no other changes. I will pass out\nflow charts and documents showing how the program was created.\n\n",
