  "description": "Python 101\n\nPresented by Michael Yanovich\n\nAre you completely new to Python? Have you been wanting to learn Python but\nhaven't had the time? Well give you a crash course on the basics of Python.\nWe'll start off with why Python is unique compared to other languages and then\nquickly start into basic syntax, data types, and the Python philosophy for\ncoding.\n\n[VIDEO HAS ISSUES: The presenter dropped the mic on the ground and there it\nlay. So the sound kind of sucks.]\n\n",
