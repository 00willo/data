  "description": "Data-Transfer Objects are a Disease. Meet the Cure.\n\nPresented by Aaron Oliver\n\nData Transfer Objects (DTOs) are commonplace. Every time you want to shuffle\ndata and be object-oriented about it, you crank out a new class. But then\nsomeone extends it for their purposes. Badly. Then someone ELSE extends it\nAGAIN and makes thing worse. Learn what makes our brains want to create DTOs,\nhow they've been (ab)used in the past, and how Python's namedtuple makes it\nall better.\n\n",
