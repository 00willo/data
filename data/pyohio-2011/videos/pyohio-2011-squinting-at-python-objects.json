  "description": "Squinting at Python Objects\n\nPresented by Brandon Craig Rhodes\n\nPython classes can gain attributes as if by magic. Thanks to properties,\ndescriptors, and (if all else fails) **getattr**\\ () and\n**getattribute**\\ (), the attempt to access obj.something can result in\narbitrary code execution. If you are wondering how your Python program\nis using memory, this can result in a problem: each time you look to see\nif something is there, it **is**, because it is pulled in dynamically\nthe moment you look for it. In this talk, you will learn how to prod\nPython objects gently, and hopefully learn their secrets - and their\nmemory usage - without actually invoking code.\n",
