  "description": "Squinting at Python Objects\n\nPresented by Brandon Craig Rhodes\n\nPython classes can gain attributes as if by magic. Thanks to properties,\ndescriptors, and (if all else fails) __getattr__() and __getattribute__(), the\nattempt to access obj.something can result in arbitrary code execution. If you\nare wondering how your Python program is using memory, this can result in a\nproblem: each time you look to see if something is there, it **is**, because\nit is pulled in dynamically the moment you look for it. In this talk, you will\nlearn how to prod Python objects gently, and hopefully learn their secrets -\nand their memory usage - without actually invoking code.\n\n",
