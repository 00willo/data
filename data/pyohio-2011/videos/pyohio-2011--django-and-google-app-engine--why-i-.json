  "description": "Django and Google App Engine: Why I'm Using Flask and Amazon EC2\n\nPresented by Ben Rousch\n\nI'm a lazy coder, but not the good kind of lazy. I dove into Django so I could\nhave one web framework that would work on many kind of hosting setups and for\nany kind of web project. With some modifications, I could even use the laziest\napplication host, Google App Engine. Some of these decisions didn't work out,\nso I'll share some of the lessons I've learned the past year or so.\n\n",
