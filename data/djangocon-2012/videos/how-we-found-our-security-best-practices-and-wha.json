  "summary": "Mozilla takes data security very seriously. We have AppSec, OpSec, and\nInfraSec teams, and our web developers have baked our security best practices\ninto documentation and a Django app called Funfactory. Hear how we came to\nthose best practices, what they are, and how to follow them.\n\n", 
  "description": "Privacy and security are key parts of Mozilla's mission, and we build some of\nthe largest Django applications on the web, so being at the absolutely\nforefront of security is crucial to us. And having a great user experience is,\ntoo. So over the past few years, we've developed a number of proposals, tools\n--like Bleach and django-ratelimit--and best practices, and we've wrapped\nthese up into our application template Playdoh and an app called Funfactory.\n\nI'll share those best practices and their motivations. We'll also go over a\nnumber of tools, settings, and even some fairly new web standard proposals\n(with tools, of course) to help you build the most secure Django applications\nyou can, at whatever scale you're building.\n\n",
