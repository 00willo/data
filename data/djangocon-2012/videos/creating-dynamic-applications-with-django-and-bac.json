  "description": "Django is a great tool for creating powerful database-driven web applications\nquickly. The ORM, form processing, the admin interface, and wealth of\ncommunity applications make Django the right tool for a number of situations.\n\nOne thing that Django doesn\u2019t do well is make it terribly easy to create\nhighly-interactive, dynamic interfaces. There are solutions that people are\nworking on. This talk will be about using Django with Backbone.js to help\ncreate these interfaces. Backbone.js is a Javascript framework that, in many\nways, sees the world in the same way as Django. These two tools can complement\neach other nicely.\n\nTopics:\n\n  * Similarities and differences in how the two frameworks see the world\n  * Creating REST interfaces with Django REST Framework\n  * Tools to ease the interface between Django and Backbone\n  * Templating strategies\n  * Shortcomings and implications on accessibility\n\n",
