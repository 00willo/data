  "description": "Django is a great tool for creating powerful database-driven web\napplications quickly. The ORM, form processing, the admin interface, and\nwealth of community applications make Django the right tool for a number\nof situations.\n\nOne thing that Django doesn\u2019t do well is make it terribly easy to create\nhighly-interactive, dynamic interfaces. There are solutions that people\nare working on. This talk will be about using Django with Backbone.js to\nhelp create these interfaces. Backbone.js is a Javascript framework\nthat, in many ways, sees the world in the same way as Django. These two\ntools can complement each other nicely.\n\nTopics:\n\n-  Similarities and differences in how the two frameworks see the world\n-  Creating REST interfaces with Django REST Framework\n-  Tools to ease the interface between Django and Backbone\n-  Templating strategies\n-  Shortcomings and implications on accessibility\n\n",
