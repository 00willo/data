  "summary": "A look at the past, current and future of schemas, migrations and\nDjango, and what it means for both website developers and ops staff.\n",
  "description": "Django has a long and varied history of dealing with changing schema\nrequirements - from the early projects like django-evolution and the two\naborted attempts to provide migrations in Django itself, through to\nprojects like South and now looking ahead to a more integrated solution\nwith Django itself once more.\n\nThis talk will cover some of that history - helpful to get some kind of\ncontext when it comes to current developments - as well as exploring\nsome of the common problems a migration system (and its users)\nencounter, and how those lessons and ideas are being used to help\nimprove Django itself to better support schema migrations.\n",
