  "summary": "An overview of what class-based views (CBVs) are, which ones are available,\nand how to use them in your projects. I'll also cover creating mixins, where\nfunction-based views still make sense, and how to test CBVs. As part of this,\nI'll be covering my django-braces (https://crate.io/packages/django-braces/)\npackage.\n\n", 
  "description": "It seems like most people in the Django community either don't have any idea\nhow class-based views work or are scared to try them out. I want to help with\na solid introduction to the technology.\n\n  * The usual \"who I am\" bit.\n  * Most other things in Django are classes.\n  *     * models\n  *     * forms\n  *     * even templates\n  * Views should be classes, too.\n  * What view classes are provided by Django.\n  * How to create your own mixins to clean up pain points\n  * Where function-based views are still handy.\n  * Example CBVs for common use cases\n  *     * handling form input for more than one form\n  *     * serving different content based on users\n\n",
