  "summary": "The focus of this talk will be on some pragmatic tips on how to design\nprogrammatic (non-web-based) APIs for use by other developers.\n\n", 
  "description": "If you're a developer of any sort (Django, Python, Javascript, etc), chances\nare that someone, at some point, will have to take the code you've written &\nuse it in a different context. This is even more amplified if you work on OSS,\nwhere people _will_ use it in ways you've never dreamed about.\n\nThis talk is a reflection on my experience building libraries for other\npeople's consumption & thoughts on how to design/make (non-HTTP) APIs in a way\nthat will make others love you (or at least not hunt you down & strangle you).\n\n",
