  "summary": "Django has always had a strong commitment to backwards compatibility, and is\nused by thousands of developers every day. This means that it's very difficult\nto make large sweeping changes to Django. This talk is a look at how I'd\nredesign different components of Django, if I got to do it all over again.\n\n", 
  "description": "This talk has two parts.\n\nFirst, identifying the principles we're trying to adhere to, and the problems\nwe're trying to solve by re-imagining every single API.\n\nSecond, looking at specific changes to individual APIs.\n\n",
