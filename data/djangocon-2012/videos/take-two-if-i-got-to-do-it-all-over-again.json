  "summary": "Django has always had a strong commitment to backwards compatibility,\nand is used by thousands of developers every day. This means that it's\nvery difficult to make large sweeping changes to Django. This talk is a\nlook at how I'd redesign different components of Django, if I got to do\nit all over again.\n",
  "description": "This talk has two parts.\n\nFirst, identifying the principles we're trying to adhere to, and the\nproblems we're trying to solve by re-imagining every single API.\n\nSecond, looking at specific changes to individual APIs.\n",
