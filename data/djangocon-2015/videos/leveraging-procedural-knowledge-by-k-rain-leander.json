  "summary": "Leveraging Procedural Knowledge\n\nOn the road to senior developer, one has to learn multiple languages. This often seems like a series of massive obstacles wherein each new language resembles a new beginning. However, developers may often underestimate the extent to which procedural knowledge from one language transfers to a new language. In this talk, I will demonstrate that the process from Red Hat Technical Account Manager to Django Girls workshop participant to OpenShift developer was a series of procedural knowledge transfers, wherein the obstacles to learning reduces with each new technology that is learned. I will provide specific examples, from using editors to troubleshooting issues, and conclude with practical recommendations on which language to start with and how to create a coherent plan for transitioning from one language to another.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/HIXQ/",
