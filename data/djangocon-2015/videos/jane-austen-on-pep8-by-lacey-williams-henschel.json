  "summary": "Jane Austen on PEP8: Tips from an English Major on Writing Better Code\n\nI have two English degrees, and I\u2019ve identified some concrete ways this makes me a better developer. This talk will discuss how we can take lessons from literature to write more readable code, make better tests, and create more usable websites.\n\nI\u2019ll compare Two Scoops of Django to Strunk and White\u2019s The Elements of Style, that familiar freshman comp text, to explore how they are more alike than they are different. We\u2019ll discuss the importance of readability, creating a \u201cstory arc\u201d in your tests through good user stories, how variables names have characterization, and the importance of whitespace and good formatting to everyone. I\u2019ll also compare PEP8 to the MLA Handbook; there\u2019s a reason both disciplines have a style guide!",
