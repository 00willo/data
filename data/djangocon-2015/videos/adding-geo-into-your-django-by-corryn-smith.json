  "summary": "Adding Geo into your Django by Corryn Smith\n\nThis presentation will teach the audience the basics of GIS and GeoDjango. Once you know how to set up a Django project, putting a map on your webpage hasn't been easier. During my talk, I will show you how to navigate through the GeoDjango documentation as well as other handy tools such as Mapbox and Leaflet. In addition, I will show the audience two GeoDjango examples \u2013 a project about my Study Abroad trip and an interactive campus map! The overall objective is for the audience to know that GeoDjango exists, how to use it, and to promote creativity for their next project!\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/HH7w/",
