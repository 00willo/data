  "summary": "Consequences of an Insightful Algorithm\n\nWe have ethical responsibilities when coding. We\u2019re able to extract remarkably precise intuitions about an individual. But do we have a right to know what they didn\u2019t consent to share, even when they willingly shared the data that leads us there? A major retailer\u2019s data-driven marketing accidentially revealed to a teen\u2019s family that she was pregnant. Eek.\n\nWhat are our obligations to people who did not expect themselves to be so intimately known without sharing directly? How do we mitigate against unintended outcomes? For instance, an activity tracker carelessly revealed users\u2019 sexual activity data to search engines. A social network\u2019s algorithm accidentally triggered painful memories for grieving families who\u2019d recently experienced death of their child and other loved ones.\n\nWe design software for humans. Balancing human needs and business specs can be tough. It\u2019s crucial that we learn how to build in systematic empathy.\n\nIn this talk, we\u2019ll delve into specific examples of uncritical programming, and painful results from using insightful data in ways that were benignly intended. You\u2019ll learn ways we can integrate practices for examining how our code might harm individuals. We\u2019ll look at how to flip the paradigm, netting consequences that can be better for everyone.\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/HIYS/",
