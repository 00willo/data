  "summary": "How to Practice Inclusion and Benefit Django by Kojo Idrissa\n\nWHAT: Inclusion Defined\n\nNot about morality\nInclusion vs. Diversity vs. Political Correctness\nWHY: Why does this matter?\n\nInherent limits on community membership: not ALL 7 billion humans will join AND contribute\nInclusion lets you maximize the number of contributors\nHOW: How do I DO this better?\n\nCheck your assumptions\nZen of Python on Inclusiveness\nErrors should never pass silently\nCheck for exceptions\nDiscuss errors when they occur\nIn the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess: how much does the ambiguity matter?\nGet out of your bubble\nFlip the Demographics\nUnderstanding The Power of Privilege\nYour Personal Privilege Matrix\nPrivilege Arbitrage\n\"Turn Your Sadness Into Kindness\"\nClosing\n\nWhat if you feel you can't?\n\nIf your heart's not really into it or you feel it's \"too hard\", be honest with yourself and just hang around others like you. An insincere effort often does more harm than good.\n\nRecognize that this behavior may leave you isolated from a large (and growing) portion of the community.\n\nIt's up to all of us\n\nJust as systems tend towards entropy, if you leave a community alone it tends towards toxicity. Good communities require continual effort. - Jacob Kaplan-Moss\n\nHelp us caption & translate this video!\n\nhttp://amara.org/v/HHB0/",
