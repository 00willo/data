  "summary": "", 
  "description": "In this talk, Anna will argue how physical computing \u2014 building interactive systems such as robots that sense and act upon, or respond to the physical world \u2014 provides an ideal application space for teaching and learning programming concepts and problem solving; that appeals to a diverse audience; and that can provide a positive introduction to the world of open source software and hardware.\r\n\r\nDrawing on her experiences teaching introductory programming with Arduino-based robots, Anna will step through a tutorial demonstrating how to develop a mobile PyBot - a robot programmed using Python and the Firmata protocol, and will provide tips to help you or the apprentice coders in your life to take the first steps towards a lifetime of loving to code.",
