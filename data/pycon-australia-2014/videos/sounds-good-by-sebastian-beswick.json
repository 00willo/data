  "description": "Do you know if it\u2019s worth upgrading your Spotify account to stream songs at 320kb/s?\r\n\r\nAn understanding of the fundamentals of computer sound is essential for the well-rounded IT professional. Audio is a field that is teeming with jargon, but it doesn\u2019t have to be so scary!
