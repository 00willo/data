  "summary": "Today's dominating two-factor authentication standard was invented long before the web; it's not secure nor usable enough. This led a group of IT-giants to develop the U2F open standard. We'll start by showing U2F in action, explain how it works and why it's needed, then add U2F to a Django application.",
