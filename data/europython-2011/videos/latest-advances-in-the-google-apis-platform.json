  "description": "This talk will give an outline of the advances that Google have made in\nAPI delivery over the last year, and how it is relevant to you as a\nPython developer. The talk is suitable for beginners and advanced\ndevelopers.\n\nWe will describe the underlying platform, and the built-in features that\nall Google APIs inherit.\n\nWe will focus on how the Python libraries for this API platform are\ngenerated and can be used as a single library that doesn't require\nupdating with API updates, as Python lends itself perfectly to the\nnature of this platform.\n",
