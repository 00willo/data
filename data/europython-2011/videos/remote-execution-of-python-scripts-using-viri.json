  "description": "Viri is a system for automatic distribution and execution of Python code on\nremote machines. This is especially useful when dealing with a large group of\nhosts.\n\nWith Viri, Sysadmins can write their own scripts, and easily distribute and\nexecute them on any number of remote machines. Depending on the number of\ncomputers to administrate, Viri can save thousands of hours, that Sysadmins\nwould spend transferring files, logging into remote hosts, and waiting for the\nscripts to finish. Viri automates the whole process.\n\nViri can also be useful for remotely managing host settings. It should work\ntogether with an application where the information about hosts would be\nmaintained. This information can include cron tasks, firewall rules, backup\nsettings,etc. After a simple Integration of this application with your Viri\ninfrastructure, you can change any settings in the application, and see how it\ngets applied on the target host automatically.\n\nThe talk will cover next topics:\n\n  * Introduction to Viri\n  * Live demo on how to install Viri, write a Viri task, and execute it in a remote host\n  * Security concerns using Viri\n\nCheck [Viri project page](http://www.viriproject.com)\n\n",
