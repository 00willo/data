  "description": "libcloud is an open-source client library for interacting with different cloud\nproviders.\n\nThe primary goal of the library is to abstract all the provider differences\naway and expose common functionality in a nice, clean and concise API.\n\nThis talk will address the following topics:\n\n  * Why a library like this was built in the first place\n  * Different problems we have encountered while building it (not all the providers always play nice)\n  * An introduction to the library API (compute, storage and load-balancer part)\n  * How to use it to build something useful and fun\n  * How to participate and contribute\n  * Roadmap and plans for the future\n\n",
