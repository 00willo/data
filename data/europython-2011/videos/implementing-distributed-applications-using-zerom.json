  "description": "Cloud Computing and Large Scale environments require sometime applications\nbased on complex and distributed architectures\u2026 and this usually means a huge\noverhead in the design and confusion out of control in the code (network wise\nrace conditions, single points of failure and so on)\n\nIntroducing elements like *MQ and IPC frameworks in this kind of applications\nis the only way to reduce the complexity and enable a fluid design (in other\nwords: mess-under-control)\n\nThe talk is focused on describing how to design a distributed application in\ndifferent scenarios, using ZeroMQ (a modern broker-less MQ system) as core\nframework, with examples and demos.\n\n",
