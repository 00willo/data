  "description": "This talk is the updated and especially enhanced of the \"Python and PostgreSQL\n- a match made in heaven\" talk of EP 2006, CERN, Switzerland. PostgreSQL and\nPython share more then the first letter: their communities have great\nsimiliarities; their development processes are really comparable; their\nlicenses and their openness to academics AND business (on a technical and\ncommunitie perspective) are big pluses. We will have a look at those\nsimiliarities and learn why PostgreSQL is really the database sister to\nPython. There will be an overview of PostgreSQL, information of how to connect\nPostgreSQL and Python; how PostgreSQL streaming replication works and what it\ncan do for you, how PL/Python helps to have Web 2.5 JSON storage and handling\nright inside PostgreSQL. We will show that YESQL is also a valid answer to\nmany data storage qeuestions.\n\n",
