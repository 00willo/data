  "description": "The Larch Environment is a visual interactive programming environment for\nJython/Python. Its purpose is to make programming more visual. To this end,\nprotocols for presenting objects visually have been devised. A programming\nenvironment, that builds on the idea of the standard visual console, allows a\nprogrammer to experiment with ideas, and develop programs at the same time.\nAdditionally, a way of embellishing source code with visual content is\npresented.\n\n",
