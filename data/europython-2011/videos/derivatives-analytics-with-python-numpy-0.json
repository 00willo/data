  "description": "In financial engineering and derivatives analytics, C/C++/Java/VBA and other\nlanguages are still dominating. Visixion has developed with\n[DEXISION](http://www.dexision.com) the first full fledged derivatives\nanalytics suite with Python as core language.\n\nDEXISION is an On Demand application that is completely Open Source based\n(LAMP). For derivatives valuation, it uses Monte Carlo simulation - an\napproach known to be computationally demanding. However, Numpy provides the\nperformance and functionality needed to implement financial simulation\nalgorithms in a fast and compact manner.\n\nThe talk illustrates the architecture of our analytics suite and demonstrates\nhow to implement fast and compact simulation algorithms with Python and Numpy.\nThe talk shows that the Python/Numpy combination reaches sufficient speed for\nproductive financial applications - something still widely doubted.\n\n[No prerequisites.]\n\n",
