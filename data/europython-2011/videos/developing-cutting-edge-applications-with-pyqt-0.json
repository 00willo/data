  "description": "(Presented with Matteo Bertozzi)\n\nPython's high development speed and Qt's gargantuan feature set allow\nfor comfortable development of complex desktop applications. Still, what\ndoes one need to do to best leverage this awesome combination? And more\nimportantly, what crucial advantages exist to decide its adoption in\nfavour of more traditional tecniques?\n\nDuring this training, we'll start from a white canvas and show how to\ndevelop a desktop application using the best tools Qt offers. You'll\nlearn how to compose complex GUIs from basic building blocks, and how to\nuse QPainter, one of the most advanced 2D painting systems in the open\nsource world. Qt's Webkit integration will be discussed, along with the\nrecent Qt Quick technology, which allows one to create smooth and fluid\nuser interfaces. Qt's solution to common deployment problems, like\nhandling a serious translation workflow, will be presented. At the end,\nwe'll package our PyQt application so it's ready to be distributed for\ndownload.\n\nWalk away with a sound understanding of why you should choose PyQt for\nyour next desktop project.\n",
