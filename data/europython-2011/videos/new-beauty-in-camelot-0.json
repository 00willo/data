  "description": "Camelot is a Python framework that leverages SQLAlchemy and QT to build rich\ndesktop applications. The model - view definition used was inspired by the\nDjango Admin interface. Some see it as a replacement for MS Access, but it's\nunderlying libraries allow much more advanced features.\n\nIn this talk we will focus on the changes and new features that were\nintroduced in Camelot and more importantly, how they can be used in your\napplications. Those features range from Matplotlib chart integration and new\ntypes of actions to displaying custom SQLAlchemy queries in a table view.\n\nWe will share our experiences with large scale deployment of Python and\nCamelot applications to the desktop of the user. In a number of case studies\nwe will point out the mistakes we made and how they were corrected.\n\n",
