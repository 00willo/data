  "description": "The \"sqlmap\" is one of the largest, widely used and most active Python\nprojects in the IT security community (more than 2000 commits in one year\nperiod with community of over 100 active testers). It combines it's\ndevelopers' strong security knowledge together with analytical, mathematical\nand Python development skills to provide IT professionals with vibrant\nfeatures.\n\nTalk would be consisted of several parts: short introduction to project and\ndevelopers, developing and testing environment, programming cycle, program's\nworkflow, technologies used, common pitfalls and how we've circumvent them,\nusage of mathematical models, optimizations, project's future goals.\n\nThe significant part of this talk would be the immediate insight into the\ndeveloping process of probably the world's most advanced open-source Python IT\nsecurity project today.\n\n",
