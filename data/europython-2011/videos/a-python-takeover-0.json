  "description": "Two years ago I started working on SourceForge with a couple of python\ndevelopers. Back then the site was written in PHP and was in some ways\nburied in technical debt. Everything is different today, we have a\ncomplete set of tools for Ticket tracking, Wiki documents, Git,\nMercurial, Subversion, and IRC - all written in Python, and now released\nas open source software.\n\nThis is the story of how the amazing libraries, tools, and talent in the\nPython web community has radically changed an established company, and\nallowed us to reinvent sourceforge.net.\n\nThis talk will go over our tech stack, talk about the libraries we used,\nthe way we solved scalability, internationalization, and performance\nissues issues. Ultimately we know that without python, we could not have\nbuilt a flexible plugin based system, and gotten permission from\nmanagement to open source it.\n",
