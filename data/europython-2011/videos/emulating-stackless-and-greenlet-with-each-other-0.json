  "description": "Stackless Python and the greenlet package for CPython are two different\nimplementations of coroutine support for Python. (Coroutines are\nfundamental building blocks of I/O frameworks like gevent, Eventlet,\nConcurrence and Syncless to conveniently handle thousands of socket\nconnections at a time without creating threads.) Stackless and greenlet\nimplement a different interface. However, each is powerful enough so\nthat it can be used to emulate the other one. In this talk we explore\nthe differences and discuss design decisions and testing strategies of\nthe emulations we have implemented.\n\n`Slides <http://syncless.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/doc/slides_2011-06-20/pts_em%20u_coro_2011-06-20.html>`__\n\n`Slides for the bonus\nsub-talk <http://syncless.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/doc/s%20lides_2010-11-29/pts_coro_2010-11-29.html>`__\n",
