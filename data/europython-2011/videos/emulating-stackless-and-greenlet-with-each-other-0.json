  "description": "Stackless Python and the greenlet package for CPython are two different\nimplementations of coroutine support for Python. (Coroutines are fundamental\nbuilding blocks of I/O frameworks like gevent, Eventlet, Concurrence and\nSyncless to conveniently handle thousands of socket connections at a time\nwithout creating threads.) Stackless and greenlet implement a different\ninterface. However, each is powerful enough so that it can be used to emulate\nthe other one. In this talk we explore the differences and discuss design\ndecisions and testing strategies of the emulations we have implemented.\n\n[Slides](http://syncless.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/doc/slides_2011-06-20/pts_em\nu_coro_2011-06-20.html)\n\n[Slides for the bonus sub-talk](http://syncless.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/doc/s\nlides_2010-11-29/pts_coro_2010-11-29.html)\n\n",
