  "description": "We had the privilege of working on a mobile web application for ETH Zurich,\nfunded by ETH North-South Centre, using Django/Postgis, jQuery mobile and\nOpenlayers technology.\n\nIn this talk, I would like to share what we have learnt technically and the\nexperiences and fun we had with polygon creation on a map and saving polygon\nvertices and related data into our spatial database via geodjango.\n\nThis mobile web app is developed based on research by Dr Koh of ETH Zurich,\nspecializing on Matrix-calibrated and edge-corrected species-area models that\nallow users to evaluate the biodiversity consequence and trade-offs of land-\nuse decisions. The development and description of these models were published\nin Conserv. Biol. 24, 994 and J. Appl. Ecol. 47, 1063.\n\n",
