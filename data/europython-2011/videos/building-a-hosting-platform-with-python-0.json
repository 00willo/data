  "description": "At ep.io we built a Python hosting platform from the ground up, designed to\nrun large numbers of web applications on a small number of physical machines\nboth securely and in a reasonably scalable way. This talk will show you how we\nbuilt our infrastructure - using Redis, eventlet, PostgreSQL and more - and\nwhat lessons we learnt from our first few thousand deploys.\n\nSee how we split services into multiple processes and greenthreads; the pains\nof building a cooperatively-multitasking PTY module; how Redis isn't the\nanswer to everything, but is still very useful; how to persuade third-party\nsoftware to work securely in a shared environment; and how important it is to\nhave good logging, especially when you have more than five servers.\n\n",
