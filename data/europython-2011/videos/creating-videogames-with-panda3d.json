  "description": "In this talk I'm going to explain the main features and possibility that\nPanda3D gives us when we want to create a game from scratch. Then, I'll\nexplain how the engine is structured and how it works conceptually going also\nthrough code examples and some practical operations.\n\nIt's meant for beginners who have also never worked with realtime graphics and\nthe only prerequisite is a bit of python knoweledge including how to write a\nsimple program and how to run it. The goal is to create a simple realtime\napplication that take care of user input and reacts depending on it.\n\n",
