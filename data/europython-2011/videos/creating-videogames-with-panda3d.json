  "description": "In this talk I'm going to explain the main features and possibility that\nPanda3D gives us when we want to create a game from scratch. Then, I'll\nexplain how the engine is structured and how it works conceptually going\nalso through code examples and some practical operations.\n\nIt's meant for beginners who have also never worked with realtime\ngraphics and the only prerequisite is a bit of python knoweledge\nincluding how to write a simple program and how to run it. The goal is\nto create a simple realtime application that take care of user input and\nreacts depending on it.\n",
