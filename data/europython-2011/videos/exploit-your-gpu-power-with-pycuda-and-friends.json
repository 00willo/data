In this\ntalk, after a brief introduction to GPU architecture, we will focus on how\nCUDA got inside Python through libraries like PyCUDA and others\u2026\n\nBy some examples we will show the main concepts and techniques for good GPU\nprogramming.\n\nThis talk targets anyone who wants to know how to exploit this technology from\nPython, the suitable use cases, the using techniques and the do-not-using\ntechniques to get the best from his own GPU\n\n",
