  "description": "To Relate or Not to Relate, that is the question raised by the NoSQL\nmovement. There is a lot of buzz about Couch, Casandra, MongoDB, and\nother non relational databases, and at the same time there are decades\nof hard work that's gone into optimizing databases built around the\nrelational model.\n\nI would actually argue that there is no such thing as a NoSQL database -\nthere are a variety of compelling options to relational database - each\nof which have different features and different performance\ncharacteristics. So no one- sized fits all comparison will do. So, I'll\ntry to outline a general taxonomy for persistence mechanisms, and then\nproceed to comparing relational DB's to their new friends in practice.\n\nThe talk will contain quite a few stories from the trenches with\nCouchDB, MongoDB, MySQL, Postgres, Tokyo Cabinet, ZODB, and other\ndatabases, and will help you think about the data storage needs of your\napplications in new ways.\n",
