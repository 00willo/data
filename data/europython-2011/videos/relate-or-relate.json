  "description": "To Relate or Not to Relate, that is the question raised by the NoSQL movement.\nThere is a lot of buzz about Couch, Casandra, MongoDB, and other non\nrelational databases, and at the same time there are decades of hard work\nthat's gone into optimizing databases built around the relational model.\n\nI would actually argue that there is no such thing as a NoSQL database - there\nare a variety of compelling options to relational database - each of which\nhave different features and different performance characteristics. So no one-\nsized fits all comparison will do. So, I'll try to outline a general taxonomy\nfor persistence mechanisms, and then proceed to comparing relational DB's to\ntheir new friends in practice.\n\nThe talk will contain quite a few stories from the trenches with CouchDB,\nMongoDB, MySQL, Postgres, Tokyo Cabinet, ZODB, and other databases, and will\nhelp you think about the data storage needs of your applications in new ways.\n\n",
