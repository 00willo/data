  "description": "Building scalable web applications may seem like a distant problem, but the\nproblem is not thinking about it before it's too late. This talk will focus on\ndesigning a scalable web application before it needs to be (and avoiding the\npremature optimization dilemma). It will cover topics such as efficient usage\nof your database, appropriate caching (and invalidation!), and what the\nspeaker considers as best practices.\n\n",
