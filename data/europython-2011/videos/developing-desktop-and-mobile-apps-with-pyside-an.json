  "description": "PySide offers Python bindings to the Qt libraries. This allows rapid\ndevelopment of great UI-based Python applications. With the addition of QML in\nQt 4.7, this now gives developers a chance to develop touch-based, rich\napplications directly with Python. This talk introduces PySide development,\ncombined with QML, and shows some real-world examples of mobile PySide\napplications.\n\nThis talk is based on my PySide/QML on [MeeGo tutorials](http://thp.io/2010\n/meego-python/), and shows some of the possibilities. It is aimed at Python\ndevelopers looking for a GUI toolkit to create fluent, hardware-accelerated\ncross-platform UIs using QML.\n\nMaterials available at:\n[http://thp.io/2011/europython/](http://thp.io/2011/europython/)\n\n",
