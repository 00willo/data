  "description": "PySide offers Python bindings to the Qt libraries. This allows rapid\ndevelopment of great UI-based Python applications. With the addition of\nQML in Qt 4.7, this now gives developers a chance to develop\ntouch-based, rich applications directly with Python. This talk\nintroduces PySide development, combined with QML, and shows some\nreal-world examples of mobile PySide applications.\n\nThis talk is based on my PySide/QML on `MeeGo\ntutorials <http://thp.io/2010%20/meego-python/>`__, and shows some of\nthe possibilities. It is aimed at Python developers looking for a GUI\ntoolkit to create fluent, hardware-accelerated cross-platform UIs using\nQML.\n\nMaterials available at: http://thp.io/2011/europython/\n",
