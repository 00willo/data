  "description": "PyF is a python framework to ease flow based programming and allow massive\ndata crunching on multiple CPUs. We boast an optional web-based interface to\nvisually design processing tubes, batch scheduling, report generation and\nemail alerts.\n\nThe Framework is easily extensible by writing plugins, a lot of features like\ndata persistence, reporting and web scrapping are already part of the\necosystem.\n\nThis presentation will focus on an introduction to PyF architecture and\nhigher-level designer ui use and how it could be useful to you.\n\nIf available, an additional training session will focus on working with the\nframework to create your own flow-based processes and plugins.\n\nFor more information: [http://www.pyfproject.org/](http://www.pyfproject.org/)\n\n",
