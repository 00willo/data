  "description": "Django makes it easy to build web sites and applications on tight deadlines -\nbut how does it deal with sites that scale up in both traffic and complexity?\nUsing Lanyrd.com as a case study, this talk will explore tricks and techniques\nfor taking advantage of what Django has to offer while coping with the\nunexpected challenges raised by a highly dynamic social web application.\n\nTopics covered will include performance monitoring and optimisation, advanced\ncaching tricks, denormalisation with Solr and Redis and finding the right\nbalance between technical elegance and pragmatism.\n\n",
