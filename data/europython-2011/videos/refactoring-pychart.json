  "description": "PyChart is a very nice program for producing print quality graphs.\nHowever, it came equipped with a rather strange API, where every class\nwas called T. It was also using the global namespace in strange and\ndisturbing ways. Furthermore, it mixed multiple distinct tasks in some\nclasses.\n\nI will show how I went about refactoring the package in order to make a\nnice and clean API. This talk is focused on teaching refactoring\nmethodology to beginner and intermediate level programmers. It will also\ngive a brief introduction to how to make beautiful graphs with PyChart.\n",
