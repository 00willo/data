  "description": "PyChart is a very nice program for producing print quality graphs. However, it\ncame equipped with a rather strange API, where every class was called T. It\nwas also using the global namespace in strange and disturbing ways.\nFurthermore, it mixed multiple distinct tasks in some classes.\n\nI will show how I went about refactoring the package in order to make a nice\nand clean API. This talk is focused on teaching refactoring methodology to\nbeginner and intermediate level programmers. It will also give a brief\nintroduction to how to make beautiful graphs with PyChart.\n\n",
