  "description": "XMPP is an open technology for real-time communication. Although primarily\nknown for its application in the IM service \"Jabber\" (and, subsequently,\ngchat/gtalk), it has numerous applications and creates new opportunities for\ninter-system communication.\n\nWhile researching for an alternative to webservices at Mendix, we came across\nXMPP and realized it solved many of the shortcomings of webservices. It is\ncurrently being used to handle all inter-system and inter-process\ncommunication in the Mendix cloud hosting environment.\n\nThe talk will give a general overview of what XMPP is, an introduction to the\nsleekxmpp python library and how the core features of xmpp can help an\narchitecture scale well horizontally.\n\nRequired knowledge: basic understanding of hosting environments.\n\n",
