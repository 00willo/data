  "description": "We will look at the limitations of available rule engines when it comes to\ncomplex pricing rules. Rob has been part of a Python team writing a pricing\nengine based on network graphs. We will show:\n\n  * Why pricing is not easy\n  * Rule engine anti-patterns, e.g. to change one price requires a week's development time, and has to be fitted into a release cycle\n  * How to make pricing rules data driven, usable by the business\n  * How the use of graphs and sets reduces the complexity\n\nRob is joined by David Layton of Grey Squirrel Consulting, who is a fellow\ncontractor working with Rob on the pricing project. He is an American\nexpatriate and Python developer, currently living and working in London. His\nbackground is in scientific computing, CRMs and Business Intelligence.\n\n",
