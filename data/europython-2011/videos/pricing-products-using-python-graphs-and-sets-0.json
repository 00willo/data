  "description": "We will look at the limitations of available rule engines when it comes\nto complex pricing rules. Rob has been part of a Python team writing a\npricing engine based on network graphs. We will show:\n\n-  Why pricing is not easy\n-  Rule engine anti-patterns, e.g. to change one price requires a week's\n   development time, and has to be fitted into a release cycle\n-  How to make pricing rules data driven, usable by the business\n-  How the use of graphs and sets reduces the complexity\n\nRob is joined by David Layton of Grey Squirrel Consulting, who is a\nfellow contractor working with Rob on the pricing project. He is an\nAmerican expatriate and Python developer, currently living and working\nin London. His background is in scientific computing, CRMs and Business\nIntelligence.\n",
