  "description": "Django is an excellent web development platform with an extensive developers\ncommunity. It may be the most popular Python web framework nowadays. However,\nthe exisiting django based CMS products are not as feature complete as other\ncomparable solutions (Drupal, Plone, Alfresco, ModX, etc.).\n\nThe Merengue project tries to fill this gap. It is financed by the University\nof M\u00e1laga (Spain) and takes advantage of existing code and knowledge from\nother projects (Plone, Drupal, Pinax, django-cms, feincms, LFC, etc.)\n\n",
