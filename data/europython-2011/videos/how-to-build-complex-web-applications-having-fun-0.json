  "description": "Web development is a complexity challenge nowadays. Growing number of\nfunctionalities results in customer expectations increase which makes project\ndesign more difficult. Using proper tools that suite your customer needs is\nessential.\n\nIn this talk I would like to present two successful stories using closely\ntogether Pyramid and Plone. Basing on these examples I wished to highlight the\nmain reasons for using Plone as a CMS only and letting Pyramid do the rest\n(vertical application). Moreover, I will underscore good and bad practices\nduring integration process and how to make farsighted architectural decisions\nin a right moment.\n\nPrerequisites: be familiarized with common python web framework concepts.\n\n",
