  "summary": "[EuroPython 2011] Thierry Carrez - 23 June 2011 in \"Track Lasagne\"\n",
  "description": "OpenStack is an innovative open source project written in Python, backed\nby Rackspace Hosting and NASA, building a massively-scalable and\nreliable cloud computing platform.\n\nThe first part of this talk will clarify the place of OpenStack in the\ngeneral \"cloud\" landscape and explain why a fully open cloud\ninfrastructure stack is necessary to avoid vendor lock-in. We'll then\nfocus on the OpenStack project goals, its developer community, its open\ndesign and release processes, and the developer tools it chose.\n\nThe second part of the talk will present into more technical details the\ndifferent components of OpenStack: Nova (compute) and Swift (storage),\nincluding the Python libraries that are used (libvirt, SQLAlchemy,\neventlet\u2026). A Q&A session at the end of the talk will give the audience\na chance to clear any remaining dark area.\n",
