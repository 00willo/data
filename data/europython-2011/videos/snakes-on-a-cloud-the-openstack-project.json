  "description": "OpenStack is an innovative open source project written in Python, backed by\nRackspace Hosting and NASA, building a massively-scalable and reliable cloud\ncomputing platform.\n\nThe first part of this talk will clarify the place of OpenStack in the general\n\"cloud\" landscape and explain why a fully open cloud infrastructure stack is\nnecessary to avoid vendor lock-in. We'll then focus on the OpenStack project\ngoals, its developer community, its open design and release processes, and the\ndeveloper tools it chose.\n\nThe second part of the talk will present into more technical details the\ndifferent components of OpenStack: Nova (compute) and Swift (storage),\nincluding the Python libraries that are used (libvirt, SQLAlchemy, eventlet\u2026).\nA Q&A session at the end of the talk will give the audience a chance to clear\nany remaining dark area.\n\n",
