  "description": "Messaging is a well established domain in information technology and can\ngreatly improve the scalability and throughput of a system when employed\nappropriately. Message queues can be used to achieve\n\n  * spatial decoupling i.e. the systems that produce and consume messages may be deployed on different machines, networks, continents etc.\n  * temporal decoupling i.e. a system can enqueue a message and carry on without waiting for the message consumer.\n\nWe use e.g. messaging in [OpenQuake](http://openquake.org) to distribute\ncalculations of [seismic hazard](http://openquake.org/about/gem/) and the\nrespective risk to human lives and infrastructure.\n\nThere is a huge number of messaging patterns identified in the\n[industry](http://www.amazon.com/dp/0321200683/) and a small selection of\nthese will be presented to whet your appetite :-)\n\n[AMQP](http://www.amqp.org/) is a fairly new and open messaging standard with\na number of freely available open source message brokers\n([RabbitMQ](http://www.rabbitmq.com/), [ZeroMQ](http://www.zeromq.org/),\n[qpid](http://qpid.apache.org/) etc.) with different features and performance\ntrade-offs.\n\nIn the course of the presentation you will be - introduced to AMQP concepts\nand jargon - introduced to available Python AMQP bindings (focussing on an\nasynchronous ([txAMQP](https://launchpad.net/txamqp)) and a synchronous\nvariant (most likely [kombu](http://ask.github.com/kombu/)) - shown code\nexamples demonstrating how to use these Python bindings\n\nThe presentation (45 minutes in total) is structured as follows:\n\n  * 7.5 minutes for messaging concepts and patterns\n  * 7.5 minutes for AMQP concepts\n  * 5 minutes for an overview of the Python bindings for AMQP\n  * 10 minutes for txAMQP examples (asynchronous bindings)\n  * 10 minutes for kombu examples (synchronous bindings)\n  * 5 minutes for questions\n\nReferences:\n\n  * [http://www.amqp.org/](http://www.amqp.org/)\n  * [http://www.rabbitmq.com/](http://www.rabbitmq.com/)\n  * [http://www.zeromq.org/](http://www.zeromq.org/)\n  * [http://qpid.apache.org/](http://qpid.apache.org/)\n  * [https://launchpad.net/txamqp](https://launchpad.net/txamqp)\n  * [http://ask.github.com/kombu/](http://ask.github.com/kombu/)\n  * [http://www.amazon.com/dp/0321200683/](http://www.amazon.com/dp/0321200683/)\n\n",
