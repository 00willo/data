  "description": "Hadoop is the leading open source implementation of MapReduce, Google's\nlarge scale distributed computing paradigm. Hadoop's native API is in\nJava, and its built-in options for Python programming - Streaming and\nJython - have several drawbacks: the former allows to access only a\nsmall subset of Hadoop's features, while the latter carries with it all\nof the limitations of Jython with respect to CPython.\n\n`Pydoop <http://pydoop.sourceforge.net>`__ is an API for Hadoop that\nmakes most of its features available to Python programmers while\nallowing CPython development. Its core consists of Boost.Python wrappers\nfor Hadoop's C/C++ interface.\n\nThe talk consists of a MapReduce/Hadoop tutorial and a presentation of\nthe Pydoop API, with the main goal of bridging the gap between the\nHadoop and Python communities. A basic knowledge of distributed\nprogramming is helpful but not strictly required.\n",
