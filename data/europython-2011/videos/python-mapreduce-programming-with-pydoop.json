  "description": "Hadoop is the leading open source implementation of MapReduce, Google's large\nscale distributed computing paradigm. Hadoop's native API is in Java, and its\nbuilt-in options for Python programming - Streaming and Jython - have several\ndrawbacks: the former allows to access only a small subset of Hadoop's\nfeatures, while the latter carries with it all of the limitations of Jython\nwith respect to CPython.\n\n[Pydoop](http://pydoop.sourceforge.net) is an API for Hadoop that makes most\nof its features available to Python programmers while allowing CPython\ndevelopment. Its core consists of Boost.Python wrappers for Hadoop's C/C++\ninterface.\n\nThe talk consists of a MapReduce/Hadoop tutorial and a presentation of the\nPydoop API, with the main goal of bridging the gap between the Hadoop and\nPython communities. A basic knowledge of distributed programming is helpful\nbut not strictly required.\n\n",
