  "description": "The Enthought Tool Suite (ETS) is a collection of Python-based open source\ncomponents that form a foundation for nearly every application that we deliver\nto our customers. In this talk I'll demonstrate how to use ETS to rapidly\ndevelop an example scientific software application. We'll concentrate\nparticularly on introducing Traits, Traits UI, and the Chaco and Mayavi\nvisualisation tools.\n\nPrerequisites: some previous experience of working with Python and NumPy /\nSciPy is recommended.\n\n",
