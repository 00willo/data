However longs need a more complex structure which effectively\ndropped a bit of Python 3.x performance. Looking at their implementation, an\nidea grown that can help to improve the situation on common sceneries (using\n\"short\" integers). A slightly changed structure will be presented and compared\nwith the old PyIntObject and the current Python 3.2 PyLongObject, along with\nsome optimizations, thoughts, and issues found on the road, which will show\nthe effort required by such change on a Python core element.\n\n", "video_mp4_url": null, "tags": ["hacking"], "copyright_text": "Standard YouTube License", "related_urls": [], "video_flv_download_only": false, "source_url": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tzd45ho8gE", "video_webm_url": null, "video_ogv_length": null, "video_ogv_url": null, "language": "English", "video_webm_length": null, "summary": "[EuroPython 2011] Cesare Di Mauro - 24 June 2011 in \"Track Ravioli \"\n\n", "thumbnail_url": "http://i.ytimg.com/vi/9tzd45ho8gE/hqdefault.jpg", "video_flv_url": null}
