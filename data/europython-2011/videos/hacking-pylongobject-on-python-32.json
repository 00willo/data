  "description": "Beginning with Python 3 the old integer (\"int\") type has gone leaving the\nplace to \"long\", which replaced it giving a unique, uniform type to deal with\nintegers. However longs need a more complex structure which effectively\ndropped a bit of Python 3.x performance. Looking at their implementation, an\nidea grown that can help to improve the situation on common sceneries (using\n\"short\" integers). A slightly changed structure will be presented and compared\nwith the old PyIntObject and the current Python 3.2 PyLongObject, along with\nsome optimizations, thoughts, and issues found on the road, which will show\nthe effort required by such change on a Python core element.\n\n",
