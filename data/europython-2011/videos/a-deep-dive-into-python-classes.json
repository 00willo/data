  "description": "This talk aims to lift the lid on the system that governs how types behave in\nPython - everything except Metaclasses.\n\nThe talk answers questions such as:\n\n  * What is a class, and how can we think of them?\n  * How are classes instantiated?\n  * How are attributes obtained from a class or an instance?\n  * Why do I get a different thing when accessing a method via its class instead of its instance?\n  * How do the classmethod and staticmethod decorators work?\n  * How can I modify classes and instances after they've been initialised?\n  * Does any of this allow me to do any clever tricks?\n\nAttendees should understand at least the basics of object oriented programming\nin Python. This talk doesn't aim to explain object-orientation, o-o design, or\nhow Python represents objects in C.\n\n",
