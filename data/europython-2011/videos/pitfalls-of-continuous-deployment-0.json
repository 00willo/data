  "description": "Practice iterative development like the pros. Release sooner, faster,\nand more often.\n\nContinuous deployment (and testing) has started to become a reality for\nmany companies. It brings to light one of the many problems that face\nlarge product teams, but also creates some of its own. This talk will\nfocus on the pros and cons of continuous deployment, how DISQUS switched\nfrom the recurring release cycle to continuous releases, as well as\nproviding tips and arguments for adopting it in your workplace.\n",
