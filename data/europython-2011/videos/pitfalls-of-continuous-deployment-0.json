  "description": "Practice iterative development like the pros. Release sooner, faster, and more\noften.\n\nContinuous deployment (and testing) has started to become a reality for many\ncompanies. It brings to light one of the many problems that face large product\nteams, but also creates some of its own. This talk will focus on the pros and\ncons of continuous deployment, how DISQUS switched from the recurring release\ncycle to continuous releases, as well as providing tips and arguments for\nadopting it in your workplace.\n\n",
