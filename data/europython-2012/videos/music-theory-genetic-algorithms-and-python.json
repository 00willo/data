  "description": "I\u2019ll explain how a genetic algorithm written in Python solves musical\nexercises used to train composers. I\u2019ll also embarrass myself by comparing the\ncomputer generated results with solutions by the composers Johan Joseph Fux\nand Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. The presented project is a fun \u201cbrain break\u201d\nbased upon work I originally started at university. No prior musical knowledge\nwill be required as I intend to explain just enough musical theory for the\naudience to understand the nature of the problem (although I\u2019ll assume\nfamiliarity with Python).\n\n",
