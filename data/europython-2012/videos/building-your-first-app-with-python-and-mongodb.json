  "description": "MongoDB - from \u201chumongous\u201d - is an open source, non-relational, document-\noriented database. Trading off a few traditional features of databases\n(Notably joins and transactions) in order to Achieve much better performance,\nMongoDB is fast, scalable, and designed for web development. The goal of the\nproject is MongoDB to bridge the gap between key-value stores (which are fast\nand highly scalable) and traditional RDBMS systems (which queries Provide rich\nand deep functionality). This talk will introduce the rich feature set of\nmongoDB and examine how easy it is to develop with using python. We\u2019ll discuss\nthe various ODM\u2019s solutions that really let you develop quickly and how\nmongoDB can be used to easily scale.\n\n",
