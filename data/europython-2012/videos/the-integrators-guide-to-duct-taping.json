  "description": "\u201cDuct-taping\u201d different systems together is a common task, and is generally\nregarded as \u201cmostly harmless\u201d. However, \u201cduct-taping\u201d hides much more pitfalls\nthan a cursory examination might reveal, especially when the constraints\noutside the developer\u2019s control are many. In this talk, a classification of\nthe different integration scenarios is presented, along with methodologies to\nidentify them and asses their complexity: those hiding the most dangerous\npitfalls will be examined in detail, and methodologies and best practices to\navoid them will be exposed, with a special care put into considerations about\nsecurity and scalability.\n\n",
