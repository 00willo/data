  "description": "Juju is a new opensource configuration management and tool for deploying\nservices into a cloud and data center environments. Juju provides a higher\nlevel semantic to its users of service level management rather than machine\nmanagement. By rethinking this focus, Juju is able to provide real reuse of\nservice definitions in much the same way that package management allows\ndeployment and reuse of software bits in many different context. Juju\u2019s goal\nis to be the apt of the clouds. By providing these higher level semantics to\nend users, juju aims to be a preferred solution for deploying services to the\ncloud. Underneath the hood, juju is written in python, but part of its beauty\nis you can write service definitions in any language. Juju relies on zookeeper\nfor distributed coordination and state management of the managed machines, and\nLXC for higher utilization of machines and minimal separation of deployed\nservices. It can deploy to physical machines as well as cloud environments\nlike AWS/EC2 and Openstack.\n\n",
