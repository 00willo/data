I have always strived to write functional side-\neffect free code for production, and this year I have been taking functional\nprogramming for myself one step further by re-writing some of my Python tools\nin Haskell, and I would like to share my findings. In this tutorial we will\nwork through a progression of increasing in complexity fun-to-solve problems,\nobtain solutions both in Python and Haskell, in order to be able to first hand\ncompare and contrast readability, performance and development time. Bring a\nlaptop and a couple of interpreters (ipython and ghci) and lets do some\nhacking!\n\n", "video_mp4_url": null, "tags": [], "copyright_text": "Standard YouTube License", "related_urls": [], "video_flv_download_only": false, "source_url": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J992TknDAT8", "video_webm_url": null, "video_ogv_length": null, "video_ogv_url": null, "language": "English", "video_webm_length": null, "summary": "[EuroPython 2012] S Trygubenko - 5 JULY 2012 in \"Track Pizza Napoli\"\n\n", "thumbnail_url": "http://i.ytimg.com/vi/J992TknDAT8/hqdefault.jpg", "video_flv_url": null}
