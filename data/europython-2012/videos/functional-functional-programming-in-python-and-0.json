  "description": "Reaping the benefits of functional programming can be a real challenge,\nfalling anywhere between exciting and frustrating, to the point that one might\nend up feeling demotivated and embarrassed about writing in the functional\nstyle in the \u201creal world\u201d. I have always strived to write functional side-\neffect free code for production, and this year I have been taking functional\nprogramming for myself one step further by re-writing some of my Python tools\nin Haskell, and I would like to share my findings. In this tutorial we will\nwork through a progression of increasing in complexity fun-to-solve problems,\nobtain solutions both in Python and Haskell, in order to be able to first hand\ncompare and contrast readability, performance and development time. Bring a\nlaptop and a couple of interpreters (ipython and ghci) and lets do some\nhacking!\n\n",
