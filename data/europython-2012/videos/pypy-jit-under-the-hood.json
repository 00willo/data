  "description": "PyPy is probably the fastest Python implementation around, thanks to its\nautomatically generated JIT compiler. This talk explains how the JIT works\ninternally: in particular, it shows all the intermediate steps which lead to\nthe compilation of the Python source into fast machine code, and how to use\nthe right tools to inspect the output of the JIT compiler. By examining the\ninternals of the JIT, you will also learn why some code is more \u201cJIT friendly\u201d\nthan other, and how to write programs which exploits its full potential.\n\n",
