  "description": "PyPy is probably the fastest Python implementation around, thanks to its\nautomatically generated JIT compiler. This talk explains how the JIT\nworks internally: in particular, it shows all the intermediate steps\nwhich lead to the compilation of the Python source into fast machine\ncode, and how to use the right tools to inspect the output of the JIT\ncompiler. By examining the internals of the JIT, you will also learn why\nsome code is more \u201cJIT friendly\u201d than other, and how to write programs\nwhich exploits its full potential.\n",
