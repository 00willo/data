  "description": "Spotify\u2019s current catalog contains 15 million songs. Original storage of audio\nand metadata is over 500 terabytes and we\u2019re transcoding 500 000 new audio\nstreams a day. At it\u2019s best the system can make an album playable just few\nminutes after it\u2019s delivery. This talk is about building the music pipeline,\nall the way from the labels, who deliver music and metadata XML to our system,\nto the clients. Problems here are the concurrency, massive amount of data,\nenriching the metadata to provide better quality and to actually deliver 100\ngigabytes of indexes daily.\n\n",
