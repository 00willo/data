  "description": "NDB is a new Python client library for the Google App Engine Datastore. NDB\nhas an integrated multi-level cache, supports synchronous and asynchronous\ncalls, automatically batches requests, and several ways of storing structured\ndata. The thrust for developing NDB was the realization that the original\nPython datastore client library, \u201cdb\u201d, had some architectural and design flaws\nwhich were hard to fix due to strict backward compatibility requirements. But\nin the process, NDB became much more than an improved db library. NDB offers a\nnew paradigm for asynchronous APIs, based on coroutines implemented using\nPython\u2019s \u201cyield\u201d expression (and a simple event loop). It also supports a\nflexible way to create new Property classes by subclassing existing Property\nclasses.\n\n",
