  "description": "Trac is a widely used integrated bug, wiki and source control interface for\nmanaging software projects. It\u2019s very extensible and a wide range of plugins\nare available. We shall present a newly written full text search plugin for\nTrac that uses Apache Solr to make all parts of trac searchable - including\nthe source code repository and all file attachments. The session will\nintroduce Solr and show how it can be integrated into a Python project\n-including the pitfalls to avoid and the more useful features.\n\n",
