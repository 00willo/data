  "description": "Trac is a widely used integrated bug, wiki and source control interface\nfor managing software projects. It\u2019s very extensible and a wide range of\nplugins are available. We shall present a newly written full text search\nplugin for Trac that uses Apache Solr to make all parts of trac\nsearchable - including the source code repository and all file\nattachments. The session will introduce Solr and show how it can be\nintegrated into a Python project -including the pitfalls to avoid and\nthe more useful features.\n",
