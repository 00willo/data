  "description": "In the last year we have been working on a full featured, Python powered,\nRESTful Web API. We learned quite a few things on REST best patterns, and we\ngot a chance to put Python\u2019s renowned web capabilities under review, even\nreleasing a couple Open Source projects in the process. In my talk I will\nshare what we learned. We will consider \u2018pure\u2019 REST API design and its many\nhurdles. We will look at what Python as to offer in this field and finally, we\nwill dig further down by looking at some of the code we developed. Some of the\ntechnologies/stacks I\u2019ll cover are (in no particular order): Flask, PyMongo,\nMongoDB, REST, JSON, XML, Heroku. Did you know? Like it or not, there is going\nto be a REST API in your future.\n\n",
