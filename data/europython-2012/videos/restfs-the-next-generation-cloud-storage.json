It is designed to scale up from a single\nserver to thousand of nodes and delivering a high availability storage system\nwith special features for high i/o performance and network optimization for\nwork better in WAN environment. The Restfs is pure-python, but several of the\nlibraries that it depends upon use C extensions (sometimes for speed,\nsometimes to interface to pre-existing C libraries). The Project is on the\nbeginning stage, with some technology previews released. The main\ncharacteristics of the RestFS are : - Scalability, no limits on storage and\nclients size - High availability, no single point of failure and data\nreplication - Adaptative, load balancing and uniform distribution - High\nPerformance, parallel transfer, local cache consistency , data transfer by\ndifference - Flexible, S3 compatibility interface, dedicated library for\nintegration in web server and application layer This talk describes the\narchitecture, internals of RestFS and comparison among different free software\nsolutions. The session will discuss our experience in this development and\ndetailed information on performance and scalability RestFS Introduction RestFS\nWebsite\n\n", "video_mp4_url": null, "tags": [], "copyright_text": "Standard YouTube License", "related_urls": [], "video_flv_download_only": false, "source_url": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9DIpgNzC5KM", "video_webm_url": null, "video_ogv_length": null, "video_ogv_url": null, "language": "English", "video_webm_length": null, "summary": "[EuroPython 2012] F Manfredi F Mosca - 4 JULY 2012 in \"Track Ravioli\"\n\n", "thumbnail_url": "http://i.ytimg.com/vi/9DIpgNzC5KM/hqdefault.jpg", "video_flv_url": null}
