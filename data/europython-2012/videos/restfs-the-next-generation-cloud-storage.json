  "description": "The RestFS is an experimental project to develop an open-source\ndistributed filesystem for large environments. It is designed to scale\nup from a single server to thousand of nodes and delivering a high\navailability storage system with special features for high i/o\nperformance and network optimization for work better in WAN environment.\nThe Restfs is pure-python, but several of the libraries that it depends\nupon use C extensions (sometimes for speed, sometimes to interface to\npre-existing C libraries). The Project is on the beginning stage, with\nsome technology previews released. The main characteristics of the\nRestFS are : - Scalability, no limits on storage and clients size - High\navailability, no single point of failure and data replication -\nAdaptative, load balancing and uniform distribution - High Performance,\nparallel transfer, local cache consistency , data transfer by difference\n- Flexible, S3 compatibility interface, dedicated library for\nintegration in web server and application layer This talk describes the\narchitecture, internals of RestFS and comparison among different free\nsoftware solutions. The session will discuss our experience in this\ndevelopment and detailed information on performance and scalability\nRestFS Introduction RestFS Website\n",
