  "description": "Tornado is a non-blocking light-weight web server and framework. There\u2019s been\nmany introductory talks about it, and it\u2019s time to look deeper into it: not\njust what Tornado does, but how it does it and what can we learn from it when\ndesigning our own concurrent systems. We\u2019ll cover each topic in two parts:\nfirst we\u2019ll see how to use a certain feature in our applications; then, we\u2019ll\ndig into Tornado\u2019s source code to see how it really works. How much time we\u2019ll\nspend in the \u201chow to use\u201d will depend on the audience\u2019s knowledge of Tornado.\nGetting Started: quickly get a simple Tornado application up and running.\nWe\u2019ll keep digging into, changing and poking this Application for most of the\ntalk. An Application Listens: what an Application is, how does Tornado start\nit and how does it process its requests. Application and IOLoop: we\u2019ll look at\nhow the IOLoop receives the connections from the users and passes them on to\nthe Applications. Scheduled Tasks: we\u2019ll see how to schedule tasks and how the\nIOLoop will run them. Generators: we\u2019ll learn to use generators to handle the\nresponses of our asynchronous calls, and how they work with the IOLoop.\nWebsockets: how to use them and how they work. IOStream: how do Tornado\u2019s non-\nblocking sockets work. Database: how to use non-blocking sockets to connect to\na MySQL or MongoDB database.\n\n",
