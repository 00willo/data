As agile proponents say (the better of them\nat least), this does not actually solve all our problems, it merely lets us\nsee them clearer. And one thing that we can see clear once management overhead\ngoes down, is that we are perfectly able to create our own, technical,\noverhead. Developer culture and a tendency of solving problems \u2018the usual way\u2019\ncan - and does - create complicated solutions to simple problems, and\nregularly leaves us in configuration hell. This is a talk about frameworks and\nAPI:s, programming languages and data storage, and why we - developers - spend\na large amount of time not creating value. Even if we have the most perfect of\nagile implementations with zero process overhead (yeah, right!), we still\nwaste time in development, and its all our own fault. I will discuss what we\nspend our time on, why any framework should be approached with trepidation,\nand how we can do better than keep repeating the mistakes of yesteryear.\n\n", "video_mp4_url": null, "tags": [], "copyright_text": "Standard YouTube License", "related_urls": [], "video_flv_download_only": false, "source_url": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kEqwe7EGuQU", "video_webm_url": null, "video_ogv_length": null, "video_ogv_url": null, "language": "English", "video_webm_length": null, "summary": "[EuroPython 2012] Fredrik Haard - 5 JULY 2012 in \"Track Lasagne\"\n\n", "thumbnail_url": "http://i.ytimg.com/vi/kEqwe7EGuQU/hqdefault.jpg", "video_flv_url": null}
