  "description": "zc.buildout is a tool to install and configure applications. An application\nmay consist of multiple parts and include multiple programs and processes.\nBoth installation and configuration of the application as a whole are\ncontrolled by a configuration file which makes it possible to reproduce them\nexactly at a later point in time or on a different host. zc.buildout is\nextensible so it may be used to install application parts with nearly\narbitrary individual requirements. The talk introduces zc.buildout, gives an\noverview of its possibilities as well as the major third-party extensions and\ndemonstrates the system by means of a case study.\n\n",
