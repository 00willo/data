  "description": "Take care of the most important thing, your psychophysical well-being, and be\nefficient about it. You don\u2019t need to be hungry (well, just a little bit), do\nlots of exercise (well, just a little bit) and spend a lot of time and money\n(well, just a little bit\u2026 uhm, there seems to be a pattern :-) ). You just\nneed to take care of your body using the same thing that lets you program\ncomputers: your mind. No, the human body is not \u201ca machine\u201d, as it\u2019s often\nsaid: it\u2019s much more complex than that. Nonetheless, knowledge of a few facts,\nsome guiding principles, and some tech tools (we\u2019re geeks after all, aren\u2019t\nwe? :-) ) can definitely improve your life. Warning: this speaker is not a\ndoctor, and this talk is not medical advice. Get the advice of a qualified\ndoctor/physician before changing your diet and/or your physical regimen.\nNeither this speaker nor the conference organization will be liable for any\ninjuries or illnesses you may incur by however applying the concepts discussed\nin this talk.\n\n",
