  "description": "Optimization, testing, tunning and design in sw. project can be both heaven or\nhell for a sw. development project. Python provides many tools to deal with\nthese topics but by theirselves they could not be enough. The talk tries to\nexpose techniques, self failures/success and practical tips and hints to make\nthe right choice at the right time. This talk will expose optimization,\ntesting, tunning patterns ( and other critical topics ) of a python project\nand try to analyze the options python provides ( such as packages, techiniques\nand patterns/anti-patterns ) to deal with them. There is not one true way to\ndeal with these topics and the main goal of the talks is to provide practical\nexamples/techniques and create an active discussion with the public. Main\ndiscussion topics: Testing ( modules and techniques ) Optimization and\nperformance ( analysis of the problem, profiling and tuning techniques )\nDebugging Deployment and automation Python traps\n\n",
