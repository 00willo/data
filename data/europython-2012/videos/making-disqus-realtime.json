  "description": "This talk will overview what it took to add realtime to a truly \u201cweb scale\u201d\napp. The result is the DISQUS realtime system, a highly concurrent system for\nallowing web clients to subscribe to arbitrary events in the DISQUS\ninfrastructure. The talk will be about 30 minutes with an extended\nQuestion/Answer/Open discussion time (because your ideas are good too!).\nOverview of the architecture (redis + gevent + flask) and why those choices\nwere made Numbers! how much concurrency and msg/s we are supporting with\nrealtime How we baked high availability into the application, not just the\ninfrastructure Overview of the hardware involved Lessons learned (what broke\nhard, what worked awesome) Suggested audience experience: Medium/Advanced\nlevel experience Familiarity with Flask, Gevent/Eventlet would be really good.\n\n",
