  "description": "This talk will overview what it took to add realtime to a truly \u201cweb\nscale\u201d app. The result is the DISQUS realtime system, a highly\nconcurrent system for allowing web clients to subscribe to arbitrary\nevents in the DISQUS infrastructure. The talk will be about 30 minutes\nwith an extended Question/Answer/Open discussion time (because your\nideas are good too!). Overview of the architecture (redis + gevent +\nflask) and why those choices were made Numbers! how much concurrency and\nmsg/s we are supporting with realtime How we baked high availability\ninto the application, not just the infrastructure Overview of the\nhardware involved Lessons learned (what broke hard, what worked awesome)\nSuggested audience experience: Medium/Advanced level experience\nFamiliarity with Flask, Gevent/Eventlet would be really good.\n",
