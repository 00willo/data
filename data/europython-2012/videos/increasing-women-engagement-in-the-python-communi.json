  "description": "Are you a woman wanting to break into the engineering field? Or do you know\nany women wanting to learn how to code, but don\u2019t know how to help them?\nPerhaps our nerdy ladies are a bit shy to ask for help. That\u2019s okay! I\u2019ll give\nyou some tools to nudge you in the right direction. In this session, I\u00e2??ll be\ntalking about how I increased women\u00e2??s engagement in the Python community\nthough demonstrating how versatile the language is with practical projects, by\ncreating a safe space for women to learn and to fail, and by encouraging\ninvolvement beyond the classroom.\n\n",
