  "description": "Twisted is one of the best asynchronous network programming frameworks out\nthere, and can help you build cool stuff very easily, once you understand the\ncore design. Unfortunately, Twisted is also a huge framework and can be very\ndaunting for beginners to approach. This training session aims to help people\nwith little or no asynchronous programming experience understand both Twisted\nand asynchronous programming. The plan is to cover core asynchronous topics,\nthe Twisted way, and as many practical applications as we can cover, including\nweb services, IPC, GUI applications etc. The audience should be competent in\ncore Python constructs. No previous asynchronous or threading programming\nexperience required. This is a repeat of the popular EuroPython 2011 Twisted\nTutorial, improved after feedback.\n\n",
