  "description": "Many scientists are using a laboratory notebook when conducting experiments.\nThe scientist documents each step, either taken in the experiment or\nafterwards when processing data. Due to computerized research systems,\nacquired data increases in volume and becomes more elaborate. This increases\nthe need to migrate from originally paper-based to electronic notebooks with\ndata storage, computational features and reliable electronic documentation.\nThis talks describes a laboratory notebook based on the Python data management\nsoftware DataFinder. It allows to manage data from experiments and\nsimulations, to run analysis software and to create visualizations of results.\nThe laboratory notebook assures that the complete history of all performed\nsteps (\"Provenance\") is recorded, that results can be signed digitally, and\nthat results can be archived in a secure archive to avoid and prevent legal\nissues.\n\n",
