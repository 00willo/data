  "description": "Sockets are a fundamental abstraction operating systems provide to\nexpose networking operations. Initially they look like a fairly straight\nforward interface but they hide a surprising amount of complexity. Many\nprotocol libraries hide sockets away from the developer but it can still\nbe useful to know the sockets themselves. Other times directly using\nsockets is just a better or simpler option. This talk will cover\npractical socket programming in python, concentrating on TCP and UDP\nover IP (v4 & v6) the basic APIs of address resolution and using sockets\nwill be covered. Common patterns and pitfalls will be pointed out which\nshould enable to you to write robust socket code with the help of tools\nlike StringIO and memoryview. After the basics python\u2019s higher level\nabstractions like create\\_connection(), .makefile() and the io module\nare covered, explaining when and how these can make life easier. Finally\na quick look at how non-blocking sockets can be used and how libraries\nlike asyncore/asynchat, twisted, eventlet and gevent all approach\nnon-blocking I/O in their own way.\n",
