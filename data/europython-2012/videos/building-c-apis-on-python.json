  "description": "Python has great support for interfacing with C/C++ code, and this has been\nused to great advantage by exposing many C/C++ libraries as Python modules. In\nthis talk, I will reverse the equation. I will show you how you can - and why\nyou might want to - build C++ APIs on top of Python modules and use them\ndirectly from your C++ programs. The topics will include: Conversion of types\nacross the language boundary. Implementation of C++ idioms (e.g. the\nbegin()/end() iterator API) on top of Python idioms. Python runtime\nmanagement: initialization, module loading, etc. Working with the \u201cimpedance\nmismatches\u201d between the languages (e.g. duck-typing vs. static typing) I will\nalso discuss the reasons why C++ APIs on Python code represent a very useful\nand often powerful technique. The reasons range from simple pragmatism (you\nwant to use an existing Python module in an existing C++ program) to\nproductivity (writing Python code plus a C++ wrapper can be easier and faster\nthan writing pure C++.) link - [https://docs.google.com/presentation/d\n/1hx_59DMQm6ZlI3Jz-LX-\nDZ4m5LVLpGcSlk1Dq1PiELI/edit](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d\n/1hx_59DMQm6ZlI3Jz-LX-DZ4m5LVLpGcSlk1Dq1PiELI/edit)\n\n",
