  "description": "Mixins enable code re-usage across class hierarchies, adapters allow for\nadditional run-time behaviour \u2014 metachao aspects merge these two concept and\ngo beyond: they can be applied to classes, instances and aspects themselves,\nallowing for functional meta-programming in python. Their beauty will be\ndemonstrated by example of dictionary trees, where all behaviour is\nimplemented in form of aspects and applied to different dictionary\nimplementations. The goal of the talk is to get an understanding of how aspect\noriented programming can look and why dictionary trees in combination with\naspects are a cool way of designing applications.\n\n",
