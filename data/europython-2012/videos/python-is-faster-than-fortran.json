  "description": "Many people may think that Python is slow because it is compiled to byte code.\nThis presentation shows that Python can be fast even for computational\nintensive applications. In the example presented here, Python competes with\nFORTRAN, a programming languages renowned for its performance and aggressively\noptimizing compilers. Python offers powerful data structures such as sets that\nmake writing efficient algorithms extremely simple. FORTRAN on the other hand,\nhas much less in such support. For the given example, it takes considerably\nmore programming in FORTRAN than in Python to achieve similar execution times\nfor large data sizes. The comparison of program run times and lines of code,\nwhich can be roughly translated into development effort, shows that Python can\nactually be faster than FORTRAN under many circumstances typically found in\nreal life.\n\n",
