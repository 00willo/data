  "description": "I will talk about some experiences about the API of the Scripting Layer for\nAndroid (SL4A) which is included in the Python-for-Android Package. The\nsimplicity of the SL4A API lets students code mobile Python programs in a\nquick and easy way. Some properties of the Android GUI and the underlying\nLinux are discussed using an GPS tracking application and some standard Python\napplications like the Web Application Framework Web2py. This talk is intended\nfor beginners who have some experience with Python but none with Android and\nthe Py4A library. It\u2019s not going into details, but more on how easy it was,\nporting Python code on Android and using especially the Android GUI with the\nScripting Layer for Android (SL4A).\n\n",
