  "description": "I will talk about some experiences about the API of the Scripting Layer\nfor Android (SL4A) which is included in the Python-for-Android Package.\nThe simplicity of the SL4A API lets students code mobile Python programs\nin a quick and easy way. Some properties of the Android GUI and the\nunderlying Linux are discussed using an GPS tracking application and\nsome standard Python applications like the Web Application Framework\nWeb2py. This talk is intended for beginners who have some experience\nwith Python but none with Android and the Py4A library. It\u2019s not going\ninto details, but more on how easy it was, porting Python code on\nAndroid and using especially the Android GUI with the Scripting Layer\nfor Android (SL4A).\n",
