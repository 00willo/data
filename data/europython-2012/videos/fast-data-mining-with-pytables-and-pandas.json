  "description": "In a number of industries, like financial services or utilities, it is\nimportant to analyze huge sets of data in an efficient and fast manner.\nTypical solutions that are based on SQL databases or follow some kind of\ndata warehouse approach are generally quite expensive and demand for\nhuge computing power. Using the Python libraries PyTables and pandas\nbrings high performance data mining to your desktop computer or even\nnotebook. The talk illustrates how to beneficially apply these libraries\nin the context of financial time series and other data sets. It is also\nillustrated how you can implement fast calculations on data sets which\ndo not fit into the memory of your computer. In addition, the talk\nprovides a number of examples for the visualization of your data mining\nefforts.\n",
