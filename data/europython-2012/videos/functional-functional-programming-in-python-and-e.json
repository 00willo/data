  "description": "Reaping the benefits of functional programming can be a real challenge,\nfalling anywhere between exciting and frustrating, to the point that one\nmight end up feeling demotivated and embarrassed about writing in the\nfunctional style in the \u201creal world\u201d. I have always strived to write\nfunctional side- effect free code for production, and this year I have\nbeen taking functional programming for myself one step further by\nre-writing some of my Python tools in Haskell, and I would like to share\nmy findings. In this tutorial we will work through a progression of\nincreasing in complexity fun-to-solve problems, obtain solutions both in\nPython and Haskell, in order to be able to first hand compare and\ncontrast readability, performance and development time. Bring a laptop\nand a couple of interpreters (ipython and ghci) and lets do some\nhacking!\n",
