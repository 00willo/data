  "description": "The Living Coder\n\nPresented by Richard Clark\n\nAbstract\n\nTales, anecdotes philosophy and musings about the life that surrounds the code\nwe write.\n\nOutline\n\nThe project manager called me to his office and said \"I know you did this in\ntwo weeks in perl, but applications here must be written in java, because java\nprogrammers are much easier to find\". When I left 6 months later, the same\nmanager said \"You wouldn't happen to know any java programmers would you? we\nhave nobody to replace you..\". This is the story of the life that exists\naround the code we write.\n\n[VIDEO HAS ISSUES: Sound and video are poor. Slides are hard to read.]\n\n",
