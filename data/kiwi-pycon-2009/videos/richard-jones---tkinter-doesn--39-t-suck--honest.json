  "description": "Tkinter doesn't suck, honest\n\nPresented by Richard Jones\n\nAbstract\n\nIn this talk I hope to dispel the myth that Tkinter just plain sucks through\nthe use of some concrete examples of simple use resulting in effective user\ninterfaces.\n\nOutline\n\nI intend to cover some basics of getting Tkinter GUIs up and running, and then\nlook at some simple use-cases, including: - file dialogs in minutes - script\nconfiguration dialog - basics of interface design / packing - a look at the\nwidgets built in - a look at some of the extensions\n\n[VIDEO HAS ISSUES: Sound and video are poor. Slides are hard to read.]\n\n",
