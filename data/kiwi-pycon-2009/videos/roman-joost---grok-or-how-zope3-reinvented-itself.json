One of the main aspects of Grok is the rapid\ndevelopment of web applications without losing the flexibility Zope 3\nprovides. The talk covers a quick introduction to Zope 3 and Grok. Based\non an example, I will provide a quick walk through on how easy it is to\ncreate sophisticated web applications with Grok. Additionally, the talk\noutlines pitfalls for newcomers and how to avoid them.\n\n[VIDEO HAS ISSUES: Sound and video are poor. Slides are hard to read.]\n",
