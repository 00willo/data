  "description": "Testing Demo\n\nPresented by Michael Dunstan\n\nAbstract\n\nLive demo of writing code and tests.\n\nOutline\n\nThis live demo is intended for people that have not seen test driven\ndevelopment in action before. See what a failing test should look like.\nAnd then I'll attempt to write some code to make that test pass so that\nyou can see what a successful test run looks like - I may need some help\nfrom the audience at that point. Along the way you'll see various\nfeatures of the test framework 'nose' in action and even some doctests.\nThis will be a second attempt of the stunt first performed:\n`http://nzpug.org/MeetingsAuckland/Augus\nt2009. <http://nzpug.org/MeetingsAuckland/August2009>`__\n\nSlides: `http://www.slideshare.net/michaeldunstan/testing-\nworkshop-2455697 <http://www.slideshare.net/michaeldunstan/testing-%20workshop-2455697>`__\n\n[VIDEO HAS ISSUES: Sound and video are poor. Slides are hard to read.]\n",
