  "description": "How we use Twisted in Launchpad\n\nPresented by Michael Hudson-Doyle\n\nAbstract\n\nLaunchpad is a large, open source, \"real world\" Python project with many\nmoving parts. This talk will explain how Twisted helps us keep track of\nthem.\n\nOutline\n\nAlthough we don't use it for the core web application, most other places\nin Launchpad that have to deal with concurrency issues do it using\nTwisted. This talk will survey these areas and talk about issues we've\nfound and design patterns we've found helpful.\n\n[VIDEO HAS ISSUES: Sound and video are poor. Slides are hard to read.]\n",
