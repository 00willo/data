  "description": "Building web animation application with Python-ogre\n\nPresented by Indy Liu\n\nAbstract\n\nIn building our online user-customisable animation system, we needed a\n3D engine that is powerful, stable and flexible. We are lucky to have\nmade python-ogre our choice. Combined with FFMpeg and the boto library,\nwe were able to build the whole solution in python with as little hassle\nas possible.\n\nOutline\n\n-  Open source python game engines;\n-  What we need - Not just a game engine;\n-  What you can do with python-ogre;\n-  Combining with other libraries FFMpeg, boto;\n-  Interfacing with the web - celery;\n\n[VIDEO HAS ISSUES: Sound and video are poor. Slides are hard to read.]\n",
