  "summary": "GeoPandas extends the pandas data analysis library to work with\ngeographic objects.\n",
  "description": "`GeoPandas <https://github.com/kjordahl/geopandas>`__ is a library built\non top of pandas to extend its capabilities to allow spatial\ncalculations. The two main datatypes are ``GeoSeries`` and\n``GeoDataFrame``, extending pandas ``Series`` and ``DataFrame``,\nrespectively. A ``GeoSeries`` contains a collection of geometric objects\n(such as ``Point``, ``LineString``, or ``Polygon``) and implements\nnearly all ``Shapely`` operations. These include unary operations (e.g.\n``centroid``), binary operations (e.g. ``distance``, either elementwise\nto another ``GeoSeries`` or to a single geometry), and cumulative\noperations (e.g. ``unary_union`` to combine all items to a single\ngeometry).\n\nA ``GeoDataFrame`` object contains a column of geometries (itself a\n``GeoSeries``) that has special meaning. GeoDataFrames can be easily\ncreated from spatial data in other formats, such as shapefiles. Rows in\nthe ``GeoDataFrame`` represent features, and columns represent\nattributes. Pandas' grouping and aggregation methods are also supported.\n\nGeoPandas objects can optionally be aware of coordinate reference\nsystems (by adding a ``crs`` attribute) and transformed between map\nprojections. Basic support for plotting is included with GeoPandas.\nOther features include geocoding, export to GeoJSON, and retrieving data\nfrom a PostGIS spatial database.\n\nThis talk will describe the main features of GeoPandas and show examples\nof its use.\n",
