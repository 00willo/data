  "description": "Starting out with scientific computing in Python can be daunting: Where\ndo I start? What are the basic packages, and what is the use case for\neach of them? What are the fundamental ideas I need to understand each\npackage and how it works?\n\nIn this tutorial, we will use examples of scientific questions and\ncalculations which lead directly to the need for certain computational\ntools as a gateway to understand the basic structure of the scientific\ncomputing ecosystem. The specific packages we will touch on are\n``numpy``, ``matplotlib``, ``scipy``, ``sympy`` and ``pandas``, all\nviewed through the wonderful lens of the IPython Notebook.\n",
