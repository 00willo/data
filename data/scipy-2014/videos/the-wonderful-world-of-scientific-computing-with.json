  "description": "Starting out with scientific computing in Python can be daunting: Where do I start? What are the basic packages, and what is the use case for each of them? What are the fundamental ideas I need to understand each package and how it works?\r\n\r\nIn this tutorial, we will use examples of scientific questions and calculations which lead directly to the need for certain computational tools as a gateway to understand the basic structure of the scientific computing ecosystem. The specific packages we will touch on are `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `scipy`, `sympy` and `pandas`, all viewed through the wonderful lens of the IPython Notebook.",
