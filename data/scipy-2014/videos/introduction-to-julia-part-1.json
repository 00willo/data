  "summary": "An introduction to the new Julia language from scratch, emphasising\nsimilarities and differences with scientific Python.\n",
  "description": "Julia is a new, up-and-coming language that has many similarities to\nPython, but some differences. One of its main advantages is the speed\ngain obtained by automatically compiling all code (in a somewhat similar\nway to ``PyPy``, ``Cython``, ``numba``, etc.), despite having an\ninteractive interface very similar to that of Python.\n\nThis will be a tutorial on the basic features of Julia from scratch,\ngiven by a user (rather than a developer) of the language, emphasising\nthose features which are similar to Python (and hence do not require\nmuch explanation) and those features which are rather different.\n\nThe idea of the tutorial is to give an idea of why there is suddenly\nsuch a buzz around Julia and why it can be useful for certain projects.\n\nThis tutorial is aimed at people who are already familiar with the basic\nscientific Python packages; it is not aimed at beginners in scientific\nprogramming.\n",
