  "description": "Representing data through colours is a very common approach to conveying\nimportant information to an audience. This is done throughout all fields\nin the scientific community and stakes a claim in the commercial and\nmarketing realm as well. Colour maps and contour maps are the preferred\nway for scientists to visualise three-dimensional data in two\ndimensions. Research has shown that the choice of colourmap is crucial\nsince the human brain interpolates hue poorly. We suggest some best\npractices scientists should consider when deciding how they should\npresent their results. Specifically, we look at some examples of\ncolourmaps that can easily be misinterpreted, making reference to an\nin-depth supportive study, and suggest alternative approaches to improve\nthem. We conclude by listing some open source tools that aid making good\ncolourmap choices. Kristen Thyng's talk on perception of colourmaps in\nmatplotlib is an excellent follow-on from this.\n",
