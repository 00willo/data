  "summary": "Learn to read, manipulate, and write georeferenced imagery and other\nkinds of geospatial raster data using a productive and fun GDAL and\nNumpy-based library named Rasterio. It's a new open source project from\nthe satellite team at Mapbox and is informed by a decade of experience\nusing Python and GDAL.\n",
  "description": "Rasterio is a GDAL and Numpy-based Python library guided by lessons\nlearned over a decade of using GDAL and Python to solve geospatial\nproblems. Among these lessons: the importance of productivity,\nenjoyability, and serendipity.\n\nI will discuss the motivation for writing Rasterio and explain how and\nwhy it diverges from other GIS software and embraces Python types,\nprotocols, and idioms. I will also explain why Rasterio adheres to some\nGIS paradigms and bends or breaks others.\n\nFinally, I will show examples of using Rasterio to read, manipulate, and\nwrite georeferenced raster data. Some examples will be familiar to users\nof older Python GIS software and will illustrate how Rasterio lets you\nget more done with less code and fewer bugs. I will also demonstrate fun\nand useful features of Rasterio not found in other geospatial libraries.\n",
