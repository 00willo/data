  "summary": "We describe recent developments in the Ginga package, a open-source\nastronomical image viewer and toolkit written in python and hosted on\nGithub. The package was introduced to the scientific python community at\nSciPy 2013 and has received a number of enhancements since then based on\nuser feedback. The talk includes an image mosaicing demo of a wide-field\ncamera exposure with 116 4Kx2K CCDs.\n",
  "description": "Ginga is an open-source astronomical image viewer and toolkit written in\npython and `hosted on Github <https://github.com/ejeschke/ginga>`__. It\nuses and inter-operates with several key scientific python packages:\nnumpy, scipy, astropy and matplotlib.\n\nIn this talk/poster we describe and illustrate recent enhancements to\nthe package since the introductory talk at SciPy 2013, including:\n\n-  modular/pluggable interfaces for world coordinate systems, image file\n   I/O and star and image catalogs\n-  support for rendering into matplotlib figures\n-  support for image mosaicing\n-  support for image overlays\n-  customizable user-interface bindings\n-  improved documentation\n-  self contained Mac OS X packages\n\nDuring the talk we will demonstrate the mosaicing plugin that is being\nused with several instruments at Subaru Telescope in Hawaii, including\nthe new Hyper Suprime-Cam wide-field camera with 116 separate 4Kx2K\nCCDs.\n\nThe talk/poster may be of interest to anyone developing code in python\nneeding to display scientific image (CCD or CMOS) data and astronomers\ninterested in python-based quick look and analysis tools.\n",
