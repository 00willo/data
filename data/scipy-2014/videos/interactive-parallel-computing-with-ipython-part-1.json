  "summary": "Learn about interactive parallel computing in IPython.parallel, with\nexamples including parallel image processing, machine learning, and\nphysical simulations. IPython provides an easy way to interact with your\nmulticore laptop or compute cluster.\n",
  "description": "IPython provides tools for interactive exploration of code and data.\nIPython.parallel is the part of IPython that enables an interactive\nmodel for parallel execution, and aims to make distributing your work on\na multicore computer, local clusters or cloud services such as AWS or MS\nAzure simple and straightforward. The tutorial will cover how to do\ninteractive and asynchronous parallel computing with IPython, and how to\nget the most out of your IPython cluster. Some of IPython\u2019s novel\ninteractive features will be demonstrated, such as automatically\nparallelizing code with magics in the IPython Notebook and interactive\ndebugging of remote execution. Examples covered will include parallel\nimage processing, machine learning, and physical simulations, with\nexercises to solve along the way.\n\n-  Introduction to IPython.parallel\n-  Deploying IPython\n-  Using DirectViews and LoadBalancedViews\n-  The basic model for execution\n-  Getting to know your IPython cluster:\n-  Working with remote namespaces\n-  AsyncResult: the API for asynchronous execution\n-  Interacting with incomplete results. Remember, it\u2019s about\n   interactivity\n-  Interactive parallel plotting\n-  More advanced topics:\n-  Using IPython.parallel with traditional (MPI) parallel programs\n-  Debugging parallel code\n-  Minimizing data movement\n-  Task dependencies\n-  Caveats and tuning tips for IPython.parallel\n\n",
