  "title": "SymPy Tutorial Part 1",
  "summary": "SymPy is a pure Python library for symbolic mathematics. It aims to\nbecome a full-featured computer algebra system (CAS) while keeping the\ncode as simple as possible in order to be comprehensible and easily\nextensible. SymPy is written entirely in Python and does not require any\nexternal libraries.\n",
  "description": "In this tutorial we will introduce attendees to SymPy. We will show\nbasics of constructing and manipulating mathematical expressions in\nSymPy, the most common issues and differences from other computer\nalgebra systems, and how to deal with them. In the last part of this\ntutorial we will show how to solve some practical problems with SymPy.\nThis will include showing how to interface SymPy with popular numeric\nlibraries like NumPy.\n\nThis knowledge should be enough for attendees to start using SymPy for\nsolving mathematical problems and hacking SymPy's internals (though\nhacking core modules may require additional expertise).\n",
