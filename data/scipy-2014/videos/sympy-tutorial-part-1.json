  "title": "SymPy Tutorial Part 1", 
  "summary": "SymPy is a pure Python library for symbolic mathematics. It aims to become a full-featured computer algebra system (CAS) while keeping the code as simple as possible in order to be comprehensible and easily extensible. SymPy is written entirely in Python and does not require any external libraries.\r\n", 
  "description": "In this tutorial we will introduce attendees to SymPy. We will show basics of constructing and manipulating mathematical expressions in SymPy, the most common issues and differences from other computer algebra systems, and how to deal with them. In the last part of this tutorial we will show how to solve some practical problems with SymPy. This will include showing how to interface SymPy with popular numeric libraries like NumPy.\r\n\r\nThis knowledge should be enough for attendees to start using SymPy for solving mathematical problems and hacking SymPy's internals (though hacking core modules may require additional expertise).",
