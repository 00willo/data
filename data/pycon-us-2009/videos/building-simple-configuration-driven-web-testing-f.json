  "summary": "Building a flexible and scalable functional testing framework for your\napplication is typically an evolutionary process. You experiment and\nfind things that work, and things that don't, particularly if you have\nlittle programming experience. Sometimes, you proceed down a path that\nbinds your hands later down the road, and a massive refactor is needed.\nI would like to present a simple testing framework built upon several\nexisting, free technologies (ConfigObj, twill, nose) and models (Page\nObjects, Scenario Objects, Abstract State Machines) that is easy to\nconfigure, extend, and maintain.\n",
