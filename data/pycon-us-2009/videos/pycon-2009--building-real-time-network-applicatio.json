  "description": "  \nHaven't you always wanted to create a massively multiplayer, real-time game\nfor the browser? Or perhaps add chat to your website, or maybe write a real-\ntime financial application, collaborative text editor, or network health\nmonitoring app, all in the browser. Forget web frameworks; Orbited.TCPSocket\nlets you communicate directly from a browser to any network server, with any\nprotocol you want. By tutorial's end, every attendee will have built their own\nreal-time data monitoring application, or multiplayer game, from scratch using\nOrbited, Twisted, and js.io.\n\n",
