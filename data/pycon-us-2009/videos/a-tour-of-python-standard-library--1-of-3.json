Together let us explore the\nvarious modules, which will help you to build robust working programs. Once\nyou know about a particular library well, you will start replacing those 20\nodd lines of code you used to write with a 2-3 lines and feel safe that your\ncode will now work on all the platforms that Python supports. Just like the\ngalaxy, the Python Standard Library is vast and when hitch-hiking I will take\nyou through some important ones that happen to be used most often. You can\nexplore, ask questions, experiment through out the ride. Welcome! And let the\njourney begin.\n\n", "video_mp4_url": "http://05d2db1380b6504cc981-8cbed8cf7e3a131cd8f1c3e383d10041.r93.cf2.rackcdn.com/pycon-us-2009/169_a-tour-of-python-standard-library-1-of-3.mp4", "tags": ["pycon", "pycon2009", "python-basics", "stdlib"], "copyright_text": "Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 3.0", "related_urls": [], "video_flv_download_only": false, "source_url": "", "video_webm_url": null, "video_ogv_length": null, "video_ogv_url": null, "language": "English", "video_webm_length": null, "summary": "", "thumbnail_url": "http://a.images.blip.tv/Pycon-ATourOfPythonStandardLibraryPart001265-956.jpg", "video_flv_url": null}
