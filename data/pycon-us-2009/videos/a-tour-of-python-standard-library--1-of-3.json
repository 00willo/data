  "description": "  \nWelcome to A Tour of Python Standard Library. Together let us explore the\nvarious modules, which will help you to build robust working programs. Once\nyou know about a particular library well, you will start replacing those 20\nodd lines of code you used to write with a 2-3 lines and feel safe that your\ncode will now work on all the platforms that Python supports. Just like the\ngalaxy, the Python Standard Library is vast and when hitch-hiking I will take\nyou through some important ones that happen to be used most often. You can\nexplore, ask questions, experiment through out the ride. Welcome! And let the\njourney begin.\n\n",
