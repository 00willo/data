  "description": "  \n[VIDEO HAS ISSUES: Audio clipping, ambient mic up (echoing audio)] Paver makes\nmanaging common aspects of Python projects easier, by providing just the right\nkind of scaffolding on which to automate building and packaging of your\nsoftware. In this talk, you'll see how easy it is to get started with Paver,\nhow you can use Paver without alienating other users of your code, and how you\ncan use Paver to trivially extend Python's distutils commands.\n\n",
