  "summary": "", 
  "description": "  \nTrac, an open-source project management tool, has been gaining in popularity,\nhowever few people tap its true potential. To fully mold Trac to your team and\nproject, you must venture into the realm of custom plugins. These short (or\nnot so short) bits of code allow you to customize almost every aspect of Trac\nto your liking. Come learn how to get 110% out of your Trac system, or just\nsee what Trac can do for you. Attendees should bring a laptop for the hands-on\nportion or the tutorial.\n\n",
