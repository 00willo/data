  "description": "PyPy Status Talk\n\nPresented by Holger Krekel and Maciej Fijalkowski\n\nPyPy has come a long way. It's gone from being purely a research project\nto providing a flexible and reasonably fast Python Interpreter, itself\nimplemented in Python. Although PyPy is not yet a viable CPython\nreplacement, PyPy is able to run sophisticated python applications like\nDjango and Twisted. In this talk, we'll focus on improvements that\nhappened during the last year in PyPy. This talk will also explain the\nmotivations driving current PyPy development and its targets for the\nfuture.\n\n[VIDEO HAS ISSUES: Audio humming, other misc audio issues]\n",
