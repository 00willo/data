It's gone from being purely a research project to\nproviding a flexible and reasonably fast Python Interpreter, itself\nimplemented in Python. Although PyPy is not yet a viable CPython replacement,\nPyPy is able to run sophisticated python applications like Django and Twisted.\nIn this talk, we'll focus on improvements that happened during the last year\nin PyPy. This talk will also explain the motivations driving current PyPy\ndevelopment and its targets for the future.\n\n  \n[VIDEO HAS ISSUES: Audio humming, other misc audio issues]\n\n", "video_mp4_url": "http://05d2db1380b6504cc981-8cbed8cf7e3a131cd8f1c3e383d10041.r93.cf2.rackcdn.com/pycon-us-2009/232_pycon-2009-pypy-status-talk-72.mp4", "tags": ["pycon", "pycon2009", "pypy"], "copyright_text": "Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 3.0", "related_urls": [], "video_flv_download_only": false, "source_url": "", "video_webm_url": "", "video_ogv_length": null, "video_ogv_url": "", "language": "English", "video_webm_length": null, "summary": "", "thumbnail_url": "http://a.images.blip.tv/Pycon-PyPyStatusTalk814-335.jpg", "video_flv_url": null}
