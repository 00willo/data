  "description": "  \n[VIDEO HAS ISSUES: ] This tutorial aims to educate attendees on the the basics\nof functional testing of web applications. Is your app rendered as plain HTML?\nGreat! We'll show you how to build a test suite for it. Is your app all AJAXy?\nNo problem! We can do that too! We're going to write a web application, first\nin straight html and then with AJAX, and show you how to try to break it. At\nthe end of this hands-on session, you'll be able to write tests for almost any\nweb site, using all open-source tools and our favorite language - Python.\n\n",
