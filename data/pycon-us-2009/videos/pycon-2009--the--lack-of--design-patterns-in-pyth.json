  "description": "The (lack of) design patterns in Python\n\n  \nPresented at PyCon 2009 by Joe Gregorio\n\n  \nThere is a distinct lack of Design Patterns discussed in relation to Python.\nAre the communities ignorant of Design Patterns or is there something else\ngoing on here? This talk is based on my well-trafficked article \"Python isn't\njust Java without the compile\" and expands on that article by using Design\nPatterns as a crude metric of gaps in a programming language.\n\n  \n[VIDEO HAS ISSUES: ]\n\n",
