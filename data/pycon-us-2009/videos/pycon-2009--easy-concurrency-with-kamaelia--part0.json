  "description": "  \n[VIDEO HAS ISSUES: ] Writing concurrent applications in Python is now becoming\nnot only easier, but quite elegant and simple, thanks to Kamaelia. Kamaelia is\nan interesting component based framework originating from BBC research. It\naccomplishes concurrent processing of data from and to many protocols.\nComponents easily connect and pass data from and to each other. We are going\nto explore Kamaelia's strengths and possibilities, by running simple examples,\nthen trying nested protocol support, and maybe some other fun examples if time\npermits.\n\n",
