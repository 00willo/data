  "description": "py.test II - cross-platform and distributed testing (part 1 of 3)\n\n  \nWant to know more about advanced automated testing with Python? Use a tool\nthat allows you to ad-hoc distribute tests to multiple CPUs for speed and to\nmultiple platforms for compatibility checks? With tons of debugging help in\nfailure situations? This tutorial provides in-depth information on advanced\nusages of the popular py.test tool. We highlight its current feature set\nincluding using and writing extensions for generating HTML pages, testing\nJavascript or ReST documents. We showcase and discuss ways of distributing\ntests across CPUs and platforms and will leave time to discuss and tackle\nspecific scenarios brought up during the session. The tutorial format will be\nan interactive lecture with plenty of time for questions.\n\n  \n[VIDEO HAS ISSUES: ]\n\n",
