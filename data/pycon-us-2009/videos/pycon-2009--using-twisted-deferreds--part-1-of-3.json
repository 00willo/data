  "summary": "", 
  "description": "  \nWhile the documentation about deferreds is good, it is still not enough for\nmany. In this interactive tutorial, I will cover both the basics of deferreds\nand many non-trivial use-cases, with discussion of various approaches. Common\nmistakes, gotchas and other issues will be explained, as well as good idioms\nand techniques to use deferreds without pain. Deferreds bring asynchronous\nAPIs the clarity and programming power that is sometimes lost when using\nevent-based programming. They are an idea taken from many other programming\nlanguages, and made into a Pythonic solution If you are using Twisted, or\nwould like to use Twisted, this tutorial can help you with one of the most\nsubtle issues inherent in its APIs - Deferreds.\n\n",
