  "summary": "", 
  "description": "  \nThere are many deployment options for Python code. I'll share what has worked\nwell for me on Windows, packaging command line tools and services using py2exe\nand InnoSetup. I'll demonstrate a simple build script which creates windows\nbinaries and an InnoSetup installer in one step. In addition, I'll go over\ncommon errors which come up when using py2exe and hints on troubleshooting\nthem. This is a short talk, so there will be a follow-up Open Space session to\nshare experience and help each other solve distribution problems.\n\n",
