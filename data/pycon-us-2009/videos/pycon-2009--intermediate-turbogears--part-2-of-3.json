  "description": "  \nHave you conquered the basics of Pylons/TurboGears2 (or just taken the morning\nclass)? Do you want to understand more about how everything works, and how you\ncan go beyond the basics to understand how to customize things? This class\nwill take you from a basic understanding of how to use the framework, to a\nclear picture of how the framework pieces are put together. I will also cover\nhow to create REST+JSON based web services, we'll focus particularly on how\nall this works with rich javascript based user interfaces, but the techniques\nshould easily apply to Flex, or other \"Rich Internet Application\" tools.\n\n",
