  "summary": "Really good logging means when something goes wrong in the middle of the\nnight, you know about it, and you have enough information to fix it even if\nthe problem never repeats. At the same time, really good logging doesn't raise\nfalse alarms and doesn't require finding needles in a haystack. Logging is\nimportant, but we usually do it wrong. Let's stop doing that.\n\n",
