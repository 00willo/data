  "summary": "The Python community has learned a lot about how to use our language since we\nstarted back in the 1990s, and this talk will use simple one-slide programs to\nillustrate the crucial refactorings that can help make a large real-life\napplication far more testable and maintainable while making its code easier to\nre-use. This will not be a re-hash of Gang-of-Four refactorings, but specific\nto Python.\n\n",
