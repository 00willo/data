  "summary": "The Python community has learned a lot about how to use our language\nsince we started back in the 1990s, and this talk will use simple\none-slide programs to illustrate the crucial refactorings that can help\nmake a large real-life application far more testable and maintainable\nwhile making its code easier to re-use. This will not be a re-hash of\nGang-of-Four refactorings, but specific to Python.\n",
