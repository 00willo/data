  "title": "Video Production Strategies Using Image Sequences", 
  "summary": "Major production houses sometimes work with digital video not in non-linear\neditor format, but as large collections of image sequences in folders.

Using a series of small scripts, I'll\ndemonstrate using PyCairo or PySVG as well as ImageMagick and FFMPEG to make\n1080P HD video.\n\n",
