  "title": "Infer.py: Probabilistic Programming and Bayesian Inference from Python; SciPy 2013 Presentation", 
  "summary": "Authors: Zinkov, Rob\n\nTrack: Machine Learning\n\nInfer.py is a wrapper around Microsoft Research's Infer.NET inference engine. Infer.py allows you to represent complex graphical models in terms of short pieces of code. In this talk, I will show how many popular machine learning algorithms can be modeled as short probabilistic programs and then simply trained. I will then show how to introspect on the models which were learned and debug these programs when they don't produce desired results.",
