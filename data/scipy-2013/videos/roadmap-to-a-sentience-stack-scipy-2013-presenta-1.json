  "title": "Roadmap to a Sentience Stack; SciPy 2013 Presentation",
  "summary": "Authors: Eric Neuman\n\nTrack: Machine Learning\n\nRace cars don't look like cheetahs, so why do attempts at machine\nsentience try to look like brains? An exploration of the unique\nchallenges and immediate options along one possible path to machine\nsentience.\n\nThe \"Do Anything Machine\" is the first component in the theoretical\nSentience Stack, an open source stack of software that when put together\ncan be configured to learn to be a sentient mind. This approach is\ninspired by the LAMP stack, the collection of disparate decoupled\nopen-source components (Linux, Apache, MySQL and PHP) that were once\ncommonly used together to make it easy to create websites. LAMP reduced\nthe barriers preventing everyone from building great dynamic websites.\nIt also made it possible for individual components to be swapped out or\noptimized for a given project allowing the needs of individual projects\nto push the boundaries as needed. All of these things helped to enable\nthe explosion of growth that created the internet as we know it, and\nenable it to continue improving.\n\nAlthough currently in its very earliest stages, the Sentience Stack\nproject will rely heavily on Python's extensive meta-programming\ncapabilities and deep integration into the open source community.\n",
