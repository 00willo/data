  "description": "Authors: Kitchin, John Carnegie Mellon University\n\nTrack: Reproducible Science\n\nWe will discuss the use of emacs + org-mode + python in enabling\nreproducible research. This combination of software enables researchers\nto intertwine narrative and mathematical text with figures and code that\nis executable within a document, with capture of the output. Portions of\nthe document can be selectively exported to LaTeX, HTML, pdf and other\nother formats. We have used this method to produce technical manuscripts\nsubmitted for peer review in scientific journals, in the preparation of\ntwo e-books (about 300 pages each) on using python in scientific and\nengineering applications (http://jkitchin.github.com/pycse), and in\nusing python in the modeling of the properties of materials with density\nfunctional theory (http://jkitchin.github.com/dft-book), as well as a\npython-powered blog at http://jkitchin.github.com. Our experience\nsuggests all three components are critical for enabling reproducible\nresearch in practice: an extensible editor, a markup language that\nseparates text, math, data and code, and an effective language such as\npython. We will show examples of the pros and cons of this particular\nimplementation of editor/markup/code combination.\n",
