  "description": "Authors: Ivanov, Paul, UC Berkeley\n\nTrack: General\n\nIn this talk, I will focus on the how of reproducible research. I will\nfocus on specific tools and techniques I have found invaluable in doing\nresearch in a reproducible manner. In particular, I will cover the\nfollowing general topics (with specific examples in parentheses):\nversion control and code provenance (git), code verification (test\ndriven development, nosetests), data integrity (sha1, md5, git-annex),\nseed saving ( random seed retention ) distribution of datasets\n(mirroring, git-annex, metalinks), light-weight analysis capture (\nttyrec, ipython notebook)\n",
