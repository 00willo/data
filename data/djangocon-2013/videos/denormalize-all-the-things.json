  "summary": "Denormalize All the Things!\nNathan Duthoit\nThursday 2 p.m.--2:45 p.m.\n\nAudience level: Intermediate\n\nDescription\n\nWhat do you do when you need to cache a model but also need to query the cached data? You denormalize all the things! In this talk we will see how to create and maintain denormalized versions of some of your Django models in order to enjoy the benefits of caching while maintaining the benefits of relational data.\nAbstract\nDenormalized models: another copy of your data that you can query\n\nTypical usage (with examples):     pre-computed data     a different view of your data     combining multiple model\n\nKeeping things synced\nThe canonical data is always right\n\nYou must define the authoritative source of data and maintain it.\nKnow thy parent\n\nKeeping track of the canonical source (across database shards)\nPropagating changes     manually (call a method on save)     \"use the signals Luke\" (example)\n\nHandling concurrency issues\n\nThe approach: you can't improve what you can't measure. Measure, fix, measure again, repeat.\n\nProblems and some solutions (applying computer science goodness)     one at a time: locks and mutexes (pylock)     ensuring update order is correct",
