This talk will address the search problem, introduce a few of the tools at your disposal, and provide a way to get started using Django Haystack.\n\nThe goals is for developers new to search to understand what's different about using a search engine as an additional service, to be aware of some of the \"gotchas\", and to know not just what's possible but how to get started.\nAdvanced topics in brief     One slice at a time: Faceting     Finding Carmen Diego: Geospatial search     This, this, this: Relevance boosting     Puppies, dogs, and canines: Synonym searching",
