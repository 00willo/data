  "summary": "STATE OF THE REAL-TIME WEB WITH DJANGO\n\nThursday 11:30 a.m.--12:15 p.m.\n\nAudience level: Novice\n\nDESCRIPTION\nIn 2013, \"real-time\" is more than a buzzword: it's a reality on the Web. Unfortunately, for users of Django, it's still a foreign world that involves new concepts and new components, and it doesn't integrate well with traditional infrastructure. What is the real-time web? Why is it hard to support in Django? What are our options today? What can we expect in the future?\n\nABSTRACT\nThis talk will start by describing the protocols supporting the real-time web and showing a few use cases. Then it will explain how this new paradigm performs and scales differently from the traditional request / response cycle and it will present some software components that can help build a real-time architecture. Finally it will analyse what PEP 3156 could mean for Django.",
