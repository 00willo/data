This session will cover the advancements MySQL has made in version 5.6 and show how these new features can make your life easier. See how Global Transaction IDs and simple Python scripts (MySQL Utilities) can be used to replicate slave servers from a master and provide automatic fail over if the master dies. Discover how the improved optimizer provides better performance, handles sub-queries, and provides more tuning possibilities. New dynamic table definitions make schema changes less onerous. Discover how a NoSQL interface via memcached provides key/value pair access to data and SQL access. The new performance schema provides more insights into system tuning to eek out the last bit of performance. All that and more in less than an hour.",
