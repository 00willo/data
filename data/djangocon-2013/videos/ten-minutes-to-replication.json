Don't be; it's really not that complicated. In ten minutes, you can set up a multi-server replication cluster.\n\nABSTRACT\nWe will set up a four-server replication cluster on AWS in the first ten minutes of this class. Then we'll explain how we did it, and briefly go over some of the additional options you have for replication in PostgreSQL 9.2 and 9.3, including:\n\nbackup archiving\ncascading replication\nfailover and failback\nload-balancing options\nwhy synchronous replication isn't what you think it is\nAttendees will leave knowing how to set up a simple replication cluster on cloud hosting.",
