You add some caching, and maybe a couple extra web servers for good measure. Scaling write-heavy apps is another matter, both from an app server and a database server perspective. In this talk I'll walk through our experience scaling the University of Chicago's custom school survey application to handle over 75,000 requests per minute and upwards of 9,500 PostgreSQL transactions per second. This includes everything from django-debug-toolbar and server provisioning to load testing and consolidated logging. The following is a rough outline of topics to be covered:     Eliminating gross inefficiencies with django-debug-toolbar     Analyzing your Postgres logs for repetitive queries     Establishing a platform you can use to test     Creating a test script with JMeter     Running your test script at scale     Interpreting load test results     Things we tried that didn't work     Optimizing your web server configuration     Final tweaks to your Postgres configuration",
