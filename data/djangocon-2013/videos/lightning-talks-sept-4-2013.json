  "summary": "LIGHTNING TALKS: Sept. 04, 2013\n\nThe annual tradition of lightning talks has captivated the Django world.\n\nA lightning talk is a chance to say something to (a large subset of) the whole conference. The thing is, lightnings should last \"a MAXIMUM of five minutes.\" Allowing a minute between talks, if each talk averaged THREE minutes there would be time for roughly forty-five talks. So please don't feel that you HAVE to speak for five minutes. Say what you have to say, and stop.",
