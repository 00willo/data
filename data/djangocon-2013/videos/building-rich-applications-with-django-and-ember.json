  "summary": "Building Rich Applications with Django and Ember.js\n\nWednesday 2 p.m.--2:45 p.m.\n\nAudience level: Intermediate\n\nDescription\n\nEmber.js is the most advanced client-side JavaScript framework available: it provides optimistic server updates, automatically-updating templates and sensible defaults to dramatically increase developer productivity.\nAbstract\n\nLearn how Django and Ember.js can compliment each other: how to integrate them where their functionality overlaps and reconcile the differences where their approaches contradict.\n\nDjango helps quickly express a data model and handle HTTP requests, but using it alone isn't conducive to building highly-dynamic interfaces. Ember, on the other hand, is a client-side framework designed with precisely these interfaces in mind, but doesn't tackle the server-side at all.\n\nBoth Django and Ember.js are large, ambitious and opinionated frameworks. This is what gives them their power over their more minimalist colleagues (Flask and Backbone.js, respectively) but because their opinions sometimes differ, it can be difficult to make them play together.\n\nIn this talk, I'll briefly introduce Ember.js, compare and contrast how Django and Ember.js handle the various layers of an application, and show how to bridge between these two worlds.\n\nTopics covered: - Ember's interpretation of MVC in Django terms - Overlap in functionality: which pieces of each framework to keep, modify and throw away - Compiling Assets - Connecting Ember to Django with Ember-data and Django REST framework",
