  "summary": "TRANSACTIONS FOR WEB DEVELOPERS\nAymeric Augustin\n\nAudience level: Intermediate\n\nDESCRIPTION\nDjango has since long outgrown its roots in publishing. It's used in enterprise systems, under write-heavy workloads and strong data integrity requirements. But transaction management barely changed since the 0.9x days. Even veterans pull their hair out fighting DatabaseErrors when they use it. At last transaction handling will be overhauled in Django 1.6. How does the new system work, and why?\n\nABSTRACT\nThis talk will start from the transactional features of databases and work its way through the Python database API, up to Django's transaction management. It'll explain the downsides of Django's historical transaction handling and describe the new system introduced in Django 1.6.",
