  "summary": "SMALL SHOP / BIG SOLUTIONS: DJANGO AND LONG-TERM THINKING\n\nWednesday 4 p.m.--4:45 p.m.\n\nAudience level: Novice\n\nDESCRIPTION\nIn a small non-profit with a 10,000 year business plan, how does todays technology play a role? how does it hold up against entropy and evolve over long-periods of time? Django has done very well for us and I'd like to share some of my stories and lessons. A small shop can build big solutions that last.\n\nABSTRACT\nThis talk will focus on how Django has helped a small non-profit keep up with the big guys and 3rd party solutions over the long-term. I'll share with you how I stumbled upon it, dove in and pitched it to the rest of the company. How we (and you, through IRC #django!) took our three major sites, all running on different technoloiges, and migrated them to Django.\n\nThere is so much else out there that we use, of course and I learned some valuable lessons from Django on how to pick out the great ones. We'll get to discuss and share workflow productivity tips. Being a non-profit that takes no sides, I have the special oppourtunity to share inside stories and lessons that may be of use to you.\n\nIn smaller shops, full-stack positions are common and thats what I am. I think a lot of us are. It's hard to do so but with the help of tools such as Django we're able to pick up incredible pace and build awesome things together.",
