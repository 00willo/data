  "summary": "A look at how to get started with MongoDB using Python. The talk will\ncover basic concepts, a brief walkthrough of some more advanced\nfeatures, and how Texas A&M is using MongoDB and Python to solve some\nlarge data problems.\n",
  "description": "In the last month, we've started an effort to aggregate our logs so we\ncan do some real-time, holistic log analysis. Among other things, we are\ntracking failed logins across all points of entry, identifying possibly\ncompromised accounts (simultaneous logins from multiple IPs,\ngeographically disparate logins), and identifying high-volume mailers\nacross multiple mail relays. The talk will include an introduction to\nMongoDB (NoSQL, data structures, querying, indexing, differences from\nrelational databases, etc); some important performance and reliability\nfeatures like its support for replica sets, sharding, and map/reduce;\nand some very cool features like GridFS and geospatial indexing. All of\nthis, with the exception of database configuration, will be demoed with\nMongoDB's python client.\n",
