  "summary": "Apache Cassandra is an open source, distributed (NoSQL) database. This will\ngive a high level introduction to Cassandra and its data model; it will detail\nthe features of pycassa, the Python client library for Cassandra, and how to\ninteract with Cassandra through it.\n\n", 
  "description": "Being non-relational, Cassandra's data model is fundamentally different from\nthat of a relational database. In addition, it uses an RPC based API rather\nthan a query language. On top of that, Cassandra is a distributed database, so\nthe client must be aware of and interact with multiple nodes in the cluster.\nAll of these attributes of Cassandra make the client libraries a different\nexperience. Fortunately, the Python client library is the easiest way to use\nCassandra. This talk will start with a high level overview of the clustering\nmodel of Cassandra then its data model. A large portion of the talk will cover\nthe pycassa methods that interact with the data model of Cassandra, i.e.\ninserting, fetching, and removing data. A small amount of time will be\ndedicated to describing connection pooling in pycassa -- how it handles node\nfailures, distributes requests, etc. The final 10 minutes will be devoted to\nQ&A.\n\n",
