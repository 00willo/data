  "summary": "", 
  "description": "Ten years after the project known as \"Django\" was released to the public, there are still unanswered questions. Why did one of the original authors flee the country? What happened to all the removed magic? And, more importantly, why are there secret messages hidden in the template parser's regular expressions? I'll be attempting to throw light on some of the dark secrets of Django and, perhaps, finally divine its true purpose, after almost a decade of searching.",
