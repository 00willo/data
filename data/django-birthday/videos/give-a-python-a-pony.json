The blinking cursor in Vim was taunting me and no number of GitHub issues could motivate me to churn out more than a few lines of code in a day. This burnout, though, led me back to an early love: I started teaching full time.<br/><br/>This is a talk in two parts. In part one, I\u2019ll talk about some of the teaching triumphs I\u2019ve had and witnessed thanks to a new career, the Python and Django worlds, and my employer, Treehouse (and others!). In the second part, I\u2019ll share ways you can start teaching in your own communities and using your own talents, so we can all make the world better through learning.", "video_mp4_url": null, "tags": [], "copyright_text": "", "related_urls": [], "video_flv_download_only": false, "source_url": "http://youtu.be/5k122tiMpFA", "video_webm_url": null, "video_ogv_length": null, "video_ogv_url": null, "language": "English", "video_webm_length": null, "summary": "", "thumbnail_url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/5k122tiMpFA/hqdefault.jpg", "video_flv_url": null}
