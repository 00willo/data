  "description": "Founded in 2008, the Sunlight Foundation is a nonprofit that uses the\ncivic tech to make government more accountable and transparent. From a\nsingle Drupal site, to an organization powered by Django, we\u2019ll tell the\nstory of how a Python web framework built a successful nonprofit. The\nhistory of our open source Django apps tell the story of a growing\norganization and an open government movement. We'll cover various Django\napps we have published and how each reflected the state of our\norganization, the open government community, or Django at the time they\nwere created.\n",
