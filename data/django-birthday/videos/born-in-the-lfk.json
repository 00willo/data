  "description": "It\u2019s fitting that we gather in Lawrence, Kansas, to celebrate the 10th birthday of Django, developed and first put to use in the basement of what was once a US Post Office in downtown Lawrence. After all, as I hope to show, our lovely #LFK has a history of influencing the wider world.",
