  "description": " PyCon Canada is an initiative to strengthen the Canadian Python community.\r\n\r\nOur main goals:\r\n\r\n    Support the efforts of Montreal Python as they prepare to host PyCon North America in 2014 and 2015. This is the first time that the main PyCon conference is going to be outside of the US. Let's take this opportunity to showcase the Canadian Python community, and step up to the challenge as speakers and volunteers.\r\n    Strengthen the Canadian Python community by providing more opportunities for us to share knowledge and ideas, encourage support and education for speaking at conferences, and increase the visibility of developers, organizations, and companies within the community.\r\n    Host an annual Canadian PyCon conference, starting now - 2012!\r\n\r\nPyCon Canada is entirely run by volunteers who are passionate about these goals. We hope to see you at the 2012 conference! ",
