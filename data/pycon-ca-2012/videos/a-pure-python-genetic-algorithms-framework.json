  "title": "A Pure Python Genetic Algorithms Framework", 
  "summary": "Genetic algorithms are a class of evolutionary algorithms, which have been\naround since the mid 1950s. Since then, a lot of study has been done on these\nalgorithms, using them to solve various different types of problems. While\nmany frameworks exist to help develop and run evolutionary algorithms, mine is\naimed at simplicity for the user to create a program to execute an\nevolutionary algorithm\n\n",
