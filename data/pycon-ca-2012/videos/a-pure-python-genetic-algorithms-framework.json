  "title": "A Pure Python Genetic Algorithms Framework",
  "summary": "Genetic algorithms are a class of evolutionary algorithms, which have\nbeen around since the mid 1950s. Since then, a lot of study has been\ndone on these algorithms, using them to solve various different types of\nproblems. While many frameworks exist to help develop and run\nevolutionary algorithms, mine is aimed at simplicity for the user to\ncreate a program to execute an evolutionary algorithm\n",
