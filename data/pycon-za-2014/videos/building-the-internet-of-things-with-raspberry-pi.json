I will show you how to build basic input and output circuits and introduce you to the RPi.GPIO Python module. We\u2019ll talk about how you can build a RESTful server on your Raspberry Pi to enable remote access. And finally, more ideas for hacking everyday objects around the home!\nNo prior electronics knowledge required.", "thumbnail_url": "http://archive.org/download/pyconza2014-raspberry-pi-internet-of-things/pyconza2014-raspberry-pi-internet-of-things.thumbs/4%20A%20Building%20the%20Internet%20of%20Things%20with%20Raspberry%20Pi-_001350.jpg", "video_flv_url": ""}
