  "summary": "My journey from a user of the awesome cookiecutter, to a core member of\nan awesome += 1 community. I've learned a lot from the modest and\nmulti-talented @audreyr about leading a community, writing clean\ncross-platform Python code and putting the B in BFDL. My talk aims to\nintroduce cookiecutter to a wider audience (if you're at a PyCon and you\ncreate new projects, you need to use it) and to chart my progress from\nthe outside to the inside of an open source project.\n",
