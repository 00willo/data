  "title": "Challenges and Prospects of the Python African Computational Science and Engineering Tour Project",
  "summary": "Computer and computer based activities have pervaded our\nteaching/learning process as well as research so much so that the 21st\ncentury academic activities in science and engineering (S & E) cannot be\nfully engaged without some level of computation. An important choice of\na programming language especially in a developing country is the ease to\nlearn it and its accessibility. Python's unique features and the\npossibility that any user connected to the internet can download the\nentire packages into any platform, install it and immediately begin to\nuse it makes it a preferred environment for introducing students and new\nbeginners to elegant and all purpose programming. Therefore in Africa,\nthe Python African Tour project has been launched and I am coordinating\nits use in computational Science and Engineering (S & E) code-named\nPython African Computational Science and Engineering Tour (PACSET).\n",
