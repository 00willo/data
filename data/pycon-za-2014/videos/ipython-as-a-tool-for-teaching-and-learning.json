  "summary": "The ipython environment lends itself to teaching and learning: immediate feedback, flexible visualisation, easy access to docstrings and ability to explore modules.\nWith development of the ipython notebook, this is taken a step further, by providing browser-based access to an ipython environment with the ability to share notebooks with others, embed output products and annotate code.\nI will present some experience of using ipython as a teaching tool in a tertiary teaching environment in Radio Astronomy courses in Windhoek, Nairobi and Cape Town.",
