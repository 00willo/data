We have developed an approach which we call \u201ccommand conditioning\u201d in which the user marks up a command with hints to the interpreter which are used to transform the marked-up command into \u201c(re)conditioned\u201d native shell commands which the interpreter then launches concurrently and monitors, collects and collates output and termination status. We have implemented an initial python based command-conditioning interpreter called tardis. We describe tardis, give examples of the class of compute tasks for which it is suited, and briefly outline key compute-cluster design characteristics which support this approach. We also touch on future work such as potential integration with Galaxy, a popular python based workflow system.\r\n\r\n**Slides**\r\n\r\nhttps://speakerdeck.com/nzpug/alan-mcculloch-tardis-an-interpreter-for-command-line-parallel-execution",
