We have developed an approach which we call \u201ccommand conditioning\u201d in which the user marks up a command with hints to the interpreter which are used to transform the marked-up command into \u201c(re)conditioned\u201d native shell commands which the interpreter then launches concurrently and monitors, collects and collates output and termination status. We have implemented an initial python based command-conditioning interpreter called tardis. We describe tardis, give examples of the class of compute tasks for which it is suited, and briefly outline key compute-cluster design characteristics which support this approach. We also touch on future work such as potential integration with Galaxy, a popular python based workflow system.\r\n\r\n**Slides**\r\n\r\nhttps://speakerdeck.com/nzpug/alan-mcculloch-tardis-an-interpreter-for-command-line-parallel-execution", "video_mp4_url": null, "tags": ["talk"], "copyright_text": "CC", "related_urls": [], "video_flv_download_only": false, "source_url": "http://youtu.be/Kf8Dy8Dt6YM", "video_webm_url": null, "video_ogv_length": null, "video_ogv_url": null, "language": "English", "video_webm_length": null, "summary": "", "thumbnail_url": "http://i.ytimg.com/vi/Kf8Dy8Dt6YM/hqdefault.jpg", "video_flv_url": null}
