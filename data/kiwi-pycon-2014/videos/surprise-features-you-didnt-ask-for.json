This talk will examine some recent bugs affecting Django as well as other popular frameworks and libraries. We will look at functionality, such as parsing of XML, that just doesn't behave as any reasonable person might expect, how this can be misused and what can be done to avoid the pitfalls.\r\n\r\n**Slides**\r\n\r\nhttps://speakerdeck.com/nzpug/mike-haworth-surprise-features-you-didnt-ask-for",
