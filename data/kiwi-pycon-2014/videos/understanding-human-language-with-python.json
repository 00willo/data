Thanks to NLP, one\nday you might have your own intelligent assistant who can understand any\ndialect, who can answer your questions by finding the right answers on\nthe web, and who can help you communicate in any language through\ninstant and accurate translation.\n\nThere are many challenges that still need to be overcome for this to\nhappen, but in the meantime researchers have been finessing the building\nblocks required for NLP analysis. Some of the algorithms out there are\nquite powerful already. Many exist in Python and are readily available\nfor any Pythonista to use.\n\nThis talk will explain the main principles behind NLP and introduce some\nkey Python libraries. If you are interested in finding out more, please\nalso attend the in-depth tutorial on Friday.\n\n**Slides**\n\nhttps://speakerdeck.com/nzpug/alyona-medelyan-understanding-human-language-with-python\n",
