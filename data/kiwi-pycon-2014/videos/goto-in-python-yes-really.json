This talk rights this historical wrong by presenting a module that allows the use of goto within a function. An overview of the implementation is provided, along with rationale and performance results. Knowing what a decorator is will be helpful for understanding the technical part of this talk.\r\n\r\n**Abstract**\r\n\r\ngoto in Python\r\n\r\n - A brief history of the goto statement.\r\n - Why have a goto in Python?\r\n - Previous attempts at goto in Python\r\n - Dynamically rewriting byte codes\r\n - Problematic constructs\r\n - Performance results\r\n - Future work\r\n\r\n**Slides**\r\n\r\nhttps://speakerdeck.com/nzpug/carl-cerecke-goto-in-python-yes-really",
