The talk will cover the basics of Platform as a Service and introduce Red Hat's open source OpenShift PaaS. There will be a demonstration of how to fire up an auto-scaling spatial app with Python and MongoDB on OpenShift. We will then hit the app with some load to experiment with the scaling spatial goodness.\r\n\r\n**Slides**\r\n\r\nhttps://speakerdeck.com/nzpug/katie-miller-cloud-craft-for-spatial-cadets\r\n\r\nhttp://cloudcraft.codemiller.com/",
