The talk will cover the basics of Platform as a Service and introduce Red Hat's open source OpenShift PaaS. There will be a demonstration of how to fire up an auto-scaling spatial app with Python and MongoDB on OpenShift. We will then hit the app with some load to experiment with the scaling spatial goodness.\r\n\r\n**Slides**\r\n\r\nhttps://speakerdeck.com/nzpug/katie-miller-cloud-craft-for-spatial-cadets\r\n\r\nhttp://cloudcraft.codemiller.com/", "video_mp4_url": null, "tags": ["talk"], "copyright_text": "CC", "related_urls": [], "video_flv_download_only": false, "source_url": "http://youtu.be/YI9VNrXYIQM", "video_webm_url": null, "video_ogv_length": null, "video_ogv_url": null, "language": "English", "video_webm_length": null, "summary": "", "thumbnail_url": "http://i.ytimg.com/vi/YI9VNrXYIQM/hqdefault.jpg", "video_flv_url": null}
