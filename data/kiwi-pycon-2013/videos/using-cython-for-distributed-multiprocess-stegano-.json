  "description": "@ Kiwi PyCon 2013 - Saturday, 07 Sep 2013 - Track 2\r\n\r\n**Audience level**\r\n\r\nIntermediate\r\n\r\n**Abstract**\r\n\r\nCython is brilliant, it looks like Python but compiles to native C. It can be used as a simple way of writing lightning-fast C extensions for Python, or for a simple means of hooking into already-existing C libraries. If you are writing CPU intensive applications, like, say, hypothetically, cracking one-way cryptographic functions, Cython is a perfect mixture of simple expressiveness while making sure the 'inner loop' of your code is running as close to the bare metal as possible.\r\n\r\nAnd that's all this talk will be about, honest.\r\n\r\nWhy are you looking at me like that?\r\n\r\n**Slides**\r\n\r\nhttps://speakerdeck.com/nzpug/tom-eastman-using-cython-for-distributed-multiprocess-steganographic-md5sum-collision-generation-for-dot-dot-dot-reasons",
