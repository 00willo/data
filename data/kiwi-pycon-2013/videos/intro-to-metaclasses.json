  "description": "@ Kiwi PyCon 2013 - Saturday, 07 Sep 2013 - Track 2\r\n\r\n**Audience level**\r\n\r\nIntermediate\r\n\r\n**Abstract**\r\n\r\nPython's Metaclasses are an \"advanced\" technique, but once you get started they're surprisingly approachable.\r\n\r\nStarting with the basics, we'll:\r\n\r\n* figure out what a metaclass does\r\n* point out some existing metaclasses you might already have used\r\n* see where you might use one in your own code.\r\n\r\nWe'll compare use of a metaclass with some alternatives that don't use metaclasses, to better understand why you'd want to use them.\r\n\r\nThen we'll take a look at a couple of use-cases where using a metaclass helps us achieve a much more friendly and intuitive API than we otherwise could.\r\n\r\n**Slides**\r\n\r\nhttps://speakerdeck.com/nzpug/craig-de-stigter-intro-to-metaclasses",
