  "description": "@ Kiwi PyCon 2013 - Sunday, 08 Sep 2013 - Track 1\n\n**Audience level**\n\nIntermediate\n\n**Abstract**\n\nI'm studying Science Communication and looking at how people use the\nword science on Twitter as a way of understanding what they might mean\nwhen they say 'science'. My initial dataset is 13.5 million tweets I\ncollected during 2011. Since the start of 2012 I've been using Python\nfor my data analysis.\n\nI'll demonstrate how I've been using IPython notebook [1] with the\nPandas [2] data analysis library to work with large data tables and time\nseries data. The IPython notebook is a great tool for research, allowing\nnotes about research to be kept interleaved with the python code. The\nability to quickly see results and plot them using Matplotlib [3]\nencourages interactive exploration of the data.\n\n[1] http://ipython.org/notebook.html [2] http://pandas.pydata.org/ [3]\nhttp://matplotlib.org/\n\n**Slides**\n\nhttps://speakerdeck.com/nzpug/brenda-moon-exploring-science-on-twitter-with-ipython-notebook-and-python-pandas\n",
