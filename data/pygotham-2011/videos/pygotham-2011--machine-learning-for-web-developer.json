  "summary": "Machine learning deals with a class of algorithms which improve and evolve as\nthey process more data. It has wide-ranging applications in recommendations,\nsearch, spam/fraud detection, facial recognition and other areas. The\nalgorithms themselves will be covered but the real focus of this class is on\nhow to use said algorithms in the web applications we work on every day.\nI&aposll try to keep the math and notation relatively light. Most of the\nalgorithms you&aposll need to get started with machine learning are\nimplemented for you in the various libraries. They comprise the \"science\" of\nmachine learning and I hope you will decide to learn it, but mastering that\nmaterial is a significant commitment of your time and mental energy (and has\nsome additional prerequisites including a strong understanding of linear\nalgebra). This class will focus on the \"art\" of machine learning, how to think\nabout machine learning algorithms and integrate them into your web\napplication.\n\n",
