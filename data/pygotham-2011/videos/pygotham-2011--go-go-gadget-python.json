  "summary": "So you know that embedded devices are everywhere. Perhaps you've thought\nhow nice it would be to make a Linux USB driver for some Windows-only\ndevice, or you've got something proprietary you would like to\nreverse-engineer and repurpose for your next big scheme. We know Python\ncan do pretty much anything inside the computer--but how does a software\nperson enter the world of circuits? And once you have some circuits, how\ncan you bring the data back into your box? Bridging the worlds of\nhardware and software, I will show the power of PyUSB and Pyserial to\npwn some sweet hardware and charm it over the USB port. From my own\ntrials and tribulations building and hacking real devices, from a simple\nHID-class USB missile launcher to the custom protocol used in a complex\nbiomedical data acquisition system, you will learn about USB packet\nsniffing, rapid-prototyping device drivers in python, and deciphering\ncircuit boards and data sheets for fun & profit. I aim to leave you\narmed and ready to take on hardware of your own.\n",
