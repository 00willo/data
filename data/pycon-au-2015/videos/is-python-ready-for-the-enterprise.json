  "description": "There seems to be an opinion among some developers that Python isn't suitable for Enterprise. To put it another way, Python is great for small tasks where a scripting language works well, but not so suitable for more complicated software stacks. This talk tries to address some of these concerns. Specifically, we will look at:\n\n* Python Typing System for large code bases.\n* Is the GIL a problem?\n* The speed of Python execution.\n* The speed of Python development.\n* A case study: Caterpillar.",
