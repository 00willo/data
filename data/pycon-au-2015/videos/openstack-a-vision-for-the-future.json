  "summary": "", 
  "description": "OpenStack as a phenomenon has been explosive and rather unprecedented. The highly decentralized decision making coupled with an aggressive release cadence have allowed us to be both an inclusive body and also ship software. However, crisp vision is not necessarily an emergent property of collective thought process. It's time for some vision to be presented and championed if we're going to take the next step in our evolution.\r\n\r\nLet's talk about a vision of what OpenStack needs to be, how it needs to be shaped, and what it will take to get us there.\n\n",
