  "description": "OpenStack as a phenomenon has been explosive and rather unprecedented.\nThe highly decentralized decision making coupled with an aggressive\nrelease cadence have allowed us to be both an inclusive body and also\nship software. However, crisp vision is not necessarily an emergent\nproperty of collective thought process. It's time for some vision to be\npresented and championed if we're going to take the next step in our\nevolution.\n\nLet's talk about a vision of what OpenStack needs to be, how it needs to\nbe shaped, and what it will take to get us there.\n",
