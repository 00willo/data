You could fork the interpreter, but then nobody else could run your programs. Instead, you could implement the new behaviour as a Python module to be imported, and distribute it with your programs.\n\nFollowing hot on the tracks of previous Pycon-AU talks like \"Don't Do This\" (2013) and the \"ugly hacks\" bit of \"Here be dragons: some elegant and ugly hacks in CPython\" (2014), this presentation will grant some of the requests you never dared to make:\n\n- You'd like for PEP 336, Make None Callable to have succeeded? You can make your own None()! Easy in CPython with CTypes!\n\n- You'd like to have the \"?.\" operator available for safe attribute access? Just add the syntax to pypy, then use a source codec hack to rewrite it into a legal Python 2.7 function. Too easy!\n\n- Your reaction to all of this is \u201cplease make it stop\u201d? The talk will finish by discussing why having extensible syntax as a standard Python feature might even be a good idea! It is in other languages!\n\nThis talk is for intermediate to advanced Python users, and for beginning Python implementors.\n\nSlides: http://hiperactivo.com/talks/pyconau15/mangling_python/\n\nRepos:\n\n  - quiet_None: https://bitbucket.org/candeira/quiet_none/\n\n  - question_dot: https://bitbucket.org/candeira/question_dot/\n\n", "video_mp4_url": null, "tags": [], "copyright_text": "creativeCommon", "related_urls": [], "video_flv_download_only": false, "source_url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_LnOTFDNUk", "video_webm_url": null, "video_ogv_length": null, "video_ogv_url": null, "language": "English", "video_webm_length": null, "summary": "", "thumbnail_url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/9_LnOTFDNUk/hqdefault.jpg", "video_flv_url": null}
