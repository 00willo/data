  "description": "When you say \u201chash function\u201d in a room full of Python developers, people\ntend to think of the classics you get in hashlib: MD5, SHA-1, SHA-224,\nSHA-256, SHA-384, SHA-512, SHA-OHGODPLEASESTOP, and the like \u2014\ncryptographic hash functions intended for cryptographic uses.\n\nThere\u2019s another world out there, though: non-cryptographic hashes.\nSometimes you just need to figure out if you\u2019ve already seen a string or\nstructure. Sometimes you need a basic checksum. Sometimes you need a\nhash that\u2019s just fast and can fit into a 32 bit integer.\n\nI\u2019ll run through the state of the art in the world of non-cryptographic\nhashing \u2014 what your best options are, how they compare in terms of CPU\nand memory usage, and how they work. Who takes it? Whose mixing function\nreigns supreme?\n\nLet\u2019s find out.\n\n-  I\u2019m saying \u201cfour\u201d, but realistically I\u2019m going to cover as many\n   modern options as I can fit into the time available. Let\u2019s say \u201cfour\n   plus two or minus one\u201d in reality.\n\n",
