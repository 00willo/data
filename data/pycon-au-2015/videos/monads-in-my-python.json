  "description": "Monads shouldn't be difficult to understand. This talk aims to show what\nmonads are, and why you shouldn't be afraid of them. You most likely use\nthem already (yes, really).\n\nIn this talk, I'll touch briefly on category theory (don't worry, it's\nnot scary), and a couple of practical implementation of monads. You\ndon't have to be a functional programmer or a Haskeller to use monads.\n\nLastly I shall attempt to lay out a good rationale to use more monads\nwhen programming in Python\n",
