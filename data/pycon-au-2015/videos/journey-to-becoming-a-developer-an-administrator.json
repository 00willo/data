  "description": "As a system operator we sometimes have to create scripts to maintain our infrastructure.  However because of DevOps some of us have taken a path to move more towards a developer role.  That journey can be a bit tough specially if you don\u2019t have the proper support in place.  Fortunately for me I had some help along the way and they gave me some direction that has improved my development.
