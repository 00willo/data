  "description": "\"Ugh, why does Unicode have to be so complicated? It's just text, why can't it be as simple as writing a note for myself?\"\r\n\r\nOne of the more controversial changes in Python 3 is the decision to handle text data entirely as Unicode code points. In this presentation, CPython core developer Nick Coghlan will explore some of the background of that design decision, the capabilities it grants Python 3 over Python 2, and some of the related features of the upcoming Python 3.5 release.\n\n",
