  "description": "Web frameworks like Django are designed around the traditional request-response cycle \u2014 a request comes in, a response is generated, and that is delivered to the client. In the day of \u201csingle page\u201d applications, where only sections of the page are updated through requests, doing real-time can be clunky. Twisted, and things that build off it, like Django Channels, might be worth thinking about, and this is what this talk will be about.",
