  "description": "Late last year, JetBrains released a new version of their PyCharm IDE -\nthe Educational Edition. This version has an integrated Python console,\nDebugger and Version Control System, along with educational features\nlike the ability to create and deliver \"fill in the missing code\"\nexercises. This talk highlights my experiences using PyCharm Lessons to\nteach beginners Python. As a fairly new piece of software, there are a\nnumber of bugs that can cause a lot of pain when first starting out.\nThis talk will demonstrate the steps to creating lessons and tests,\npublishing them and sharing them with students, while avoiding problems\nwith the system. I will also share thoughts on using an IDE with\nbeginners, how students have reacted and what kind of lessons have been\nsuccessful.\n",
