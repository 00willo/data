This version has an integrated Python console, Debugger and Version Control System, along with educational features like the ability to create and deliver \"fill in the missing code\" exercises.\r\nThis talk highlights my experiences using PyCharm Lessons to teach beginners Python. \r\nAs a fairly new piece of software, there are a number of bugs that can cause a lot of pain when first starting out. This talk will demonstrate the steps to creating lessons and tests, publishing them and sharing them with students, while avoiding problems with the system. \r\nI will also share thoughts on using an IDE with beginners, how students have reacted and what kind of lessons have been successful.", "video_mp4_url": null, "tags": [], "copyright_text": "creativeCommon", "related_urls": [], "video_flv_download_only": false, "source_url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGJVDOaBkKU", "video_webm_url": null, "video_ogv_length": null, "video_ogv_url": null, "language": "English", "video_webm_length": null, "summary": "", "thumbnail_url": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/kGJVDOaBkKU/hqdefault.jpg", "video_flv_url": null}
