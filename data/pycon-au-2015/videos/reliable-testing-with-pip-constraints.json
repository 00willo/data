  "summary": "",
  "description": "pip freeze files and similar techniques like buildout have been used for\nreliable testing and reliable deployments for some time. But they are\nnot flexible enough to deal with situations like OpenStack where there\nare dozens of separate codebases, evolving independently, which still\nneed the same rigour and reliability.\n\nEnter pip constraints, new in 7.1.0. I will cover their use, design, and\nhow we're using them in devstack (and thus OpenStack CI) - and how you\ncan (and should) use them in your local projects.\n",
