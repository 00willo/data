  "title": "Privsep: A New Security Isolation Mechanism for OpenStack", 
  "summary": "", 
  "description": "OpenStack listens to requests over the network, and (when appropriate) performs operations on the host that require root superpowers.  Following best-practice design, most of the code runs as an unprivileged user and only the code that needs additional powers runs as root using a tool called \"rootwrap\".\n\nThis talk discusses the evolution that led to the current rootwrap design, why it has proven to be completely inadequate in practice, and presents a new \"privsep\" alternative currently being worked on within Oslo.",
