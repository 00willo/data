  "summary": "",
  "description": "Over the last 5-10 years, the \"desktop/server\" split that dominated\ncomputing in the 80s, 90s and early 2000s has been joined by a third\nplayer - mobile devices such as phones and tablets.\n\nSo, what is the story for running Python on these devices? Although\nthere hasn't been much to say in the past, the good news is that over\nthe last year, there's been some signficant changes in the landscape,\nand Python on Mobile is now teetering on the brink of being a genuine\nreality.\n\nIn this talk, Russell Keith-Magee will survey the current state of using\nPython on mobile devices, the work that is currently being done, areas\nwhere more work is requried, and the prospects for the future.\n",
