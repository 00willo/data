  "summary": "", 
  "description": "Flask is a python web server and web framework that makes server-side programming using Python easy. Flask has less 'magic' than Django and therefore makes server requests and responses easier to understand for students. Python Anywhere is a cloud server that allows you to easily set up a live Flask or Django application. Students can develop and debug code online without the hassle of installing and configuring their development environments. This session will look at how Flask and Python Anywhere was used in the classroom with a year 12 student cohort.",
