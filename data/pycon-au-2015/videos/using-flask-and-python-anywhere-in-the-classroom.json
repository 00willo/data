  "summary": "",
  "description": "Flask is a python web server and web framework that makes server-side\nprogramming using Python easy. Flask has less 'magic' than Django and\ntherefore makes server requests and responses easier to understand for\nstudents. Python Anywhere is a cloud server that allows you to easily\nset up a live Flask or Django application. Students can develop and\ndebug code online without the hassle of installing and configuring their\ndevelopment environments. This session will look at how Flask and Python\nAnywhere was used in the classroom with a year 12 student cohort.\n",
