  "description": "Azrael is a game engine for engineers. Unlike traditional engines it emphasises\naccurate physics, runs in the Cloud, offers a language agnostic API, and is written in (mostly) Python.\n\nIts main purpose is to make it easy for engineers to build, study, and control\ncomplex physical systems, for instance how to auto pilot a space ship; or a fleet\nthereof; in formation; through an Asteroid belt...\n\nI will show a live demo to illustrate the concept. It uses a simple control\nalgorithm to manoeuvre an object to a pre defined position in space. Once there\nit will maintain that position despite random collisions with other objects.\n\nFor more information and demo videos please visit https://olitheolix.com/azrael.\nThe code is available at https://github.com/olitheolix/azrael.",
