  "description": "Python has often been criticised for slow runtime performance, and for\nthe GIL which prevents multi-core concurrency. Cython provides tools for\naddressing both issues, and in a way that is simple enough for the\naverage programmer to use.\n\nThis talk will show:\n\n-  How to get started with Cython\n-  Tools to make day-to-day Cython work easier\n-  How to dramatically speed up a slow function\n-  How to distribute work over multiple CPU cores\n\n",
