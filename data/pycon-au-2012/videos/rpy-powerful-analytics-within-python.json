  "description": "R is an incredibly powerful statistical programming language. It is the choice\nfor powerful set and forgets analytics. However it is a specialist language\nwithout strong functionality in other areas. In areas where significant\npreprocessing of data, or where the statistics produced are part of a larger\nsystem such as looking for patterns in the load behaviour of a web server, a\nmatch with a strong general language is an obvious solution. Because of its\nwide use and potential integration with R, python is that language.\n\nThis talk will be targeted at python programmers who wish to integrate\nstatistical and data analysis into their work, providing options for real time\ndata monitoring and analysis. This talk is accessible for anyone with a basic\nunderstanding of python.\n\n",
