  "description": "R is an incredibly powerful statistical programming language. It is the\nchoice for powerful set and forgets analytics. However it is a\nspecialist language without strong functionality in other areas. In\nareas where significant preprocessing of data, or where the statistics\nproduced are part of a larger system such as looking for patterns in the\nload behaviour of a web server, a match with a strong general language\nis an obvious solution. Because of its wide use and potential\nintegration with R, python is that language.\n\nThis talk will be targeted at python programmers who wish to integrate\nstatistical and data analysis into their work, providing options for\nreal time data monitoring and analysis. This talk is accessible for\nanyone with a basic understanding of python.\n",
