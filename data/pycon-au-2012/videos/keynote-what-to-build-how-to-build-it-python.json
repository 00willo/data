  "description": "There\u2019s been a lot of buzz about \u201cLean Startups,\u201d \u201cCustomer\nDevelopment,\u201d \u201cBusiness Model Generation\u201d and related topics lately. And\nthere is a real transformation in the way we design and build products\nat work behind all that buzz.\n\nBut the fundamental principle behind all of them is applying scientific\nand experimental methodologies to product design decision making. The\ntools of Lean Startups are:\n\n-  Data collection and analysis\n-  Writing hypothesis and models\n-  Creating experiments to test those models\n-  Learning from those experiments, and refining/redesigning the model\n\nFortunately Python is a great tool for those looking to apply data\nscience to product design.\n\nPython can help with everything from statistical analysis, to rapid\ndevelopment of viable products, to the creation of complex models that\ncan be used to tweak the levers of growth, and it\u2019s easy to combine\nthese with off the shelf tools that help you analyze traffic patterns\nand figure out what product changes actually make a difference.\n",
