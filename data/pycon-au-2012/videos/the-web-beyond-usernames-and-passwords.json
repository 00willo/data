  "description": "Persona is a new cross-browser login and identity system for the web\nthat is pragmatic, federated, and serves the user.\n\nUnlike other popular solutions, it puts a strong emphasis on privacy\nprotection and makes your browser the trusted intermediary. Developed by\nMozilla, it is based on the simple idea of users demonstrating ownership\nof their email address (with a generous serving of crypto magic under\nthe hood).\n\nThis talk will give a high-level overview of the system and then show\nhow simple it is to add support for it in a Python webapp. If you want\nto make it easy for users to log into your site but don't want the risks\nand hassle of storing passwords, or if you cannot quite get your head\naround complicated authentication systems, then this talk is for you!\n",
