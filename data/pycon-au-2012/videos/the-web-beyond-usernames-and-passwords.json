  "description": "Persona is a new cross-browser login and identity system for the web that is\npragmatic, federated, and serves the user.\n\nUnlike other popular solutions, it puts a strong emphasis on privacy\nprotection and makes your browser the trusted intermediary. Developed by\nMozilla, it is based on the simple idea of users demonstrating ownership of\ntheir email address (with a generous serving of crypto magic under the hood).\n\nThis talk will give a high-level overview of the system and then show how\nsimple it is to add support for it in a Python webapp. If you want to make it\neasy for users to log into your site but don't want the risks and hassle of\nstoring passwords, or if you cannot quite get your head around complicated\nauthentication systems, then this talk is for you!\n\n",
