  "description": "I have followed the development of PyPy since 2004 and played with various\nreleases to see what the PyPy team had achieved. It wasn't until the release\nof PyPy 1.18 that I actually ran some existing production python code under\nit. The perceived performance improvement of this exercise inspired me to\nimplement a more scientific method for comparing the runtime performance of\nCPython and PyPy running various Python production code sets that we use in\nthe company I work for. This presentation will discuss the results of this\ncomparison and the positives and negatives with utilising PyPy in production.\n\n",
