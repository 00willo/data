If so then this may\nnot be the talk for you. I'm going to show you how to make a single test suite\nperform triple testing duty, so you can get on with writing the fun stuff.\n\nFirst, I'll show you how to use WebTest to construct a simple functional\ntestsuite for your application. By running in-process against a WSGI callable,\nthe tests can be fast and light enough to form part of your regularly-executed\nsuite.\n\nSecond, we'll use WSGIProxy to turn this into a deployment/acceptance test\nscript that you can point at a real live server to verify its behaviour. Run\nthis after every deployment to make sure you haven't broken something in the\nwild.\n\nFinally, we'll connect the suite to FunkLoad and pummel the server with a\ndistributed barrage of tests, to see how it copes under pressure.\n\n", "video_mp4_url": null, "tags": ["WebTest"], "copyright_text": "http://www.youtube.com/t/terms", "related_urls": [], "video_flv_download_only": false, "source_url": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8fB2qY8s2i4", "video_webm_url": null, "video_ogv_length": null, "video_ogv_url": null, "language": "English", "video_webm_length": null, "summary": "Do you enjoy writing test cases for your web application?
