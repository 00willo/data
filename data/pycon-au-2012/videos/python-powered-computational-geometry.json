  "description": "Computational Geometry is the study of geometry with the support of\nappropriate algorithms, and influences a broad range of fields of\nscience, engineering and mathematics including: Computation Fluid\nDynamics (CFD), Finite Element Modelling (FEM), Computer Aided Design /\nModelling (CAD/CAM), Robotics, Computer Graphics and Collision\nDetection.\n\nWhile it is possible to quickly implement naive versions of\ncomputational geometry algorithms in any language, such algorithms can\nbe expensive and time consuming to write, debug and maintain. The advent\nof a number of tools, including new bindings for the Computational\nGeometry Algorithms Library (CGAL) and the ipython notebook make Python\nan ideal tool for experimentation with fast and numerically robust\nalgorithms.\n\nThe presentation will include demonstrations of a number of common two-\nand three-dimensional computational geometry algorithms:\n\n-  Triangulations (and Voronoi diagrams)\n-  Mesh refinement\n-  Intersection testing\n-  Alpha shapes\n-  Convex hulls\n-  Constructive Solid Geometry\n-  Minkowski Sums\n\n",
