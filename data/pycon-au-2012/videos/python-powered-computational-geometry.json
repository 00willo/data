  "description": "Computational Geometry is the study of geometry with the support of\nappropriate algorithms, and influences a broad range of fields of science,\nengineering and mathematics including: Computation Fluid Dynamics (CFD),\nFinite Element Modelling (FEM), Computer Aided Design / Modelling (CAD/CAM),\nRobotics, Computer Graphics and Collision Detection.\n\nWhile it is possible to quickly implement naive versions of computational\ngeometry algorithms in any language, such algorithms can be expensive and time\nconsuming to write, debug and maintain. The advent of a number of tools,\nincluding new bindings for the Computational Geometry Algorithms Library\n(CGAL) and the ipython notebook make Python an ideal tool for experimentation\nwith fast and numerically robust algorithms.\n\nThe presentation will include demonstrations of a number of common two- and\nthree-dimensional computational geometry algorithms:\n\n  * Triangulations (and Voronoi diagrams)\n  * Mesh refinement\n  * Intersection testing\n  * Alpha shapes\n  * Convex hulls\n  * Constructive Solid Geometry\n  * Minkowski Sums\n\n",
