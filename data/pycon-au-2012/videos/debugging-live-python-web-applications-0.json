  "description": "Monitoring tools will record the result of what happened to your web\napplication or system when a problem arises, but for some classes of problem\nare of limited help in working out what happened, except through inference or\nby way of anecdotal evidence.\n\nThis talk will describe the limitations on what monitoring tools can help you\nwith. It will then move onto look at a range of debugging tools and techniques\nwhich can be applied to web applications, but also separate them into what can\nand cannot be used on live production web applications.\n\nTopics which will be discussed will include:\n\n  * Browser viewable error pages.\n  * Browser based debuggers.\n  * Python interactive debuggers.\n  * Post-mortem exception analysis.\n  * Methods for dumping Python stack traces\n  * Methods for dumping C stack traces.\n  * Methods for analysing thread utilisation.\n  * Interactive process introspection tools.\n  * Error reporting and logging services.\n  * Performance monitoring services.\n\n",
