Twisted provides a powerful,\nextensible event-driven framework with built-in support for many network\nprotocols. But without due care, Twisted\u2019s event-driven features can result in\ncode that\u2019s a nightmare to read and maintain. In this presentation, I will\nreview the basics of Twisted, and show some of the features which make Twisted\nsuch a popular framework. I\u2019ll share my experiences debugging and maintaining\nmission-critical Twisted applications, discuss some of the pitfalls to avoid\nwhen coding with Twisted, and present tips and tricks for debugging Twisted\ncode and writing Twisted code that\u2019s a pleasure to read and maintain.\n\n", "video_mp4_url": null, "tags": ["twisted"], "copyright_text": "http://www.youtube.com/t/terms", "related_urls": [], "video_flv_download_only": false, "source_url": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Au2PDYD6Bk", "video_webm_url": null, "video_ogv_length": null, "video_ogv_url": null, "language": "English", "video_webm_length": null, "summary": "In many Python circles, Twisted is the recommended framework for all\nnetworking and multitasking applications.
