  "summary": "The Django community is not short of ideas that could be added to the\ncore repository. Some of these ideas are great, and are just waiting for\nthe right implementation or the attention of a core developer. Other\nideas are just not going to happen. However, it's not always obvious why\nan idea will be rejected. This talk will attempt explain the reasoning\nbehind a couple of specific decisions. More broadly, this talk will aims\nto provide general guidance on the decision making process of the Django\ncore. It will also address how you can get started contributing to\nDjango.\n",
