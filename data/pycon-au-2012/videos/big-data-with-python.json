  "description": "Dealing with big data isn't a particularly new problem. There are all\nsorts of new solutions, each with their own niche, their own hype. It's\nimportant to remember that python is not \"too slow\" for big data, and\nthat with projects such as scipy, numpy, cython and rpy, python is\nbecoming a better tool then ever for data processing.
