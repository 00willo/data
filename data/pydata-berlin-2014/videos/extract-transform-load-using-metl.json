Program can be used in a\nmore general way, it can be used to load practically any kind of data to\nany target. Code is open source and available for anyone who want to use\nit. The main advantage to configurable via Yaml files and You have the\npossibility to write any transformation in Python and You can use it\nnatively from any framework as well. We are using this tool in\nproduction for many of our clients and It is really stable and reliable.\nThe project has a few contributors all around the world right now and I\nhope many developer will join soon. I really want to show you how you\ncan use it in your daily work.
