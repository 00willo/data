  "description": "This talk presents a very hands-on approach for identifying research and\ntechnology trends in various industries with a little bit of Pandas\nhere, NTLK there and all cooked up in an IPython Notebook. Three\nexamples featured in this talk are: How to find out the most interesting\nresearch topics cutting edge companies are after right now? How to pick\nsessions from a large conference program (think PyCon, PyData or Strata)\nthat are presenting something really novel? How to automagically\nidentify trends in industries such as computer vision or\ntelecommunications? The talk will show how to tackle common tasks in\napplied trend research and technology foresight from identifying a\ndata-source, getting the data and data cleaning to presenting the\ninsights in meaningful visualizations.\n",
