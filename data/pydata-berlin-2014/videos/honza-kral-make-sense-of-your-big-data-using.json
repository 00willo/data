  "title": "Make sense of your (big) data using Elasticsearch", 
  "summary": "In this talk I would like to show you a few real-life use-cases where Elasticsearch can help you make sense of your data. We will start with the most basic use case of searching your unstructured data and move on to more advanced topics such as faceting, aggregations and structured search. I would like to demonstrate that the very same tool and dataset can be used for real-time analytics as well as the basis for your more advanced data processing jobs. All in a distributed environment capable of handling terabyte-sized datasets. All examples will be shown with real data and python code demoing the new libraries we have been working on to make this process easier.",
