  "summary": "",
  "description": "For data, and data science, to be the fuel of the 21th century, data\ndriven applications should not be confined to dashboards and static\nanalyses. Instead they should be the driver of the organizations that\nown or generates the data. Most of these applications are web-based and\nrequire real-time access to the data. However, many Big Data analyses\nand tools are inherently batch-driven and not well suited for real-time\nand performance-critical connections with applications. Trade-offs\nbecome often inevitable, especially when mixing multiple tools and data\nsources. In this talk we will describe our journey to build a data\ndriven application at a large Dutch financial institution. We will dive\ninto the issues we faced, why we chose Python and pandas and what that\nmeant for real-time data analysis (and agile development). Important\npoints in the talk will be, among others, the handling of geographical\ndata, the access to hundreds of millions of records as well as the real\ntime analysis of millions of data points.\n",
