  "summary": "This talk will introduce Genie, a new programming language with a Python-\ninspired syntax that compiles into binary executables and libraries. Behind\nthe scenes, Genie is a dialect of Vala, and a full participant in the GObject\nuniverse. I will cover the language basics, with an eye to comparing them with\nPython, and guide you around some potential pitfalls. This is the second in a\nseries of talks I am giving on the topic of Python/GObject integration.\n\n",
