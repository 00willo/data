  "summary": "edx is a major django application serving huge numbers of students for MIT, Harvard, Stanford, Berkely, and more.  \r\n- A brief history of Computer-Based Instruction (python has a role);\r\n- incomplete survey of current open-source CBI;\r\n- edX: how's it different / what's it's rough structure, what (besides django/python) is involved;\r\n- edX: hacking the platform (django development);\r\n- edX: hacking courses; a deployment-level VM, and how to get started there;\r\n- finally: future topics:  deployment; what this can't do (maybe) and why;\r\n- wrapup: call for interest & edx project night(s);\r\n\r\nI'll try to have some USBs for anyone who want to try one of the edX VMs during the talk\r\n",
