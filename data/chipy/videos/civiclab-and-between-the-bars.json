  "summary": "In this talk, I will present on a slice of the maker movement called \"civic making\" and a new space that has opened up in Chicago to encourage this type creation, CivicLab.  As an example of \"civic making\" I will discuss Between the Bars, a paper based blogging platform for those who are incarcerated, built in Django.  I will also discuss our choice in framework and the pros/cons of our approach.",
