  "description": "At Pumping Station: One (Chicago's Hackerspace) people often send\nmessages to the mailing list or ask on IRC if anyone is at the space or\nplans to be later. There's an opportunity there to solve problems\nautomatically rather than through human input. Member Eric Stein\ndesigned a Python / OpenCV based application (lidless) to monitor four\nvideo cameras in the space and offer a REST API, a web front end with\nhistorical graphs, and an IRC bot in the IRC channel to relay\ninformation about how busy the space is.\n\nThis talk is a short demo of the application accompanied by motivations\nand high level archtechture breakdown. Following the demo/archtechture\nI'll dive into the parts of the code that people are most interested in\nhearing about with Q&A.\n",
