  "description": "At Pumping Station: One (Chicago's Hackerspace) people often send messages to the mailing list or ask on IRC if anyone is at the space or plans to be later. There's an opportunity there to solve problems automatically rather than through human input. Member Eric Stein designed a Python / OpenCV based application (lidless) to monitor four video cameras in the space and offer a REST API, a web front end with historical graphs, and an IRC bot in the IRC channel to relay information about how busy the space is.\r\n\r\nThis talk is a short demo of the application accompanied by motivations and high level archtechture breakdown. Following the demo/archtechture I'll dive into the parts of the code that people are most interested in hearing about with Q&A.\r\n",
