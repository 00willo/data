There's an opportunity there to solve problems automatically rather than through human input. Member Eric Stein designed a Python / OpenCV based application (lidless) to monitor four video cameras in the space and offer a REST API, a web front end with historical graphs, and an IRC bot in the IRC channel to relay information about how busy the space is.\r\n\r\nThis talk is a short demo of the application accompanied by motivations and high level archtechture breakdown. Following the demo/archtechture I'll dive into the parts of the code that people are most interested in hearing about with Q&A.\r\n", "video_mp4_url": "", "tags": ["image analysis"], "copyright_text": "", "related_urls": [{"url": "http://cons.truct.org/archives/lidless-chipy.html", "description": "blog"}], "video_flv_download_only": false, "source_url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GiUPv2Q01lw", "video_webm_url": "", "video_ogv_length": null, "video_ogv_url": "", "language": "English", "video_webm_length": null, "summary": "A great Eye, lidless, wreathed in webcams.", "thumbnail_url": "", "video_flv_url": ""}
