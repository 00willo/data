  "title": "REST-ful Web apps with Django Piston", 
  "summary": "A common complaint about Django, the leading Python web application framework,\nis that it doesn't make writing REST APIs easy enough. In fact the paradigm\nfor a typical Django application involves views which map to HTML page\ntemplates. With end users increasingly expecting rich interfaces with the\nresponsiveness of a desktop application, this paradigm is being superseded.\nFortunately a third-party Django application called Piston fills the gap.\nDjango/Piston can be combined with the Ext JS JavaScript framework and widget\nset to create attractive, responsive Web applications, and this talk will show\nyou how.\n\n",
