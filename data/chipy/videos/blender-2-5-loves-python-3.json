  "description": "Blender 2.5 loves Python 3\n\nPresented by Chris Webber on October 8th, 2009\n\nChris talks about the upcoming Blender 2.5 release. \"Blender 2.5 is the first\napp I know of that *requires* Python 3.X. So that's pretty interesting on its\nown. But there's plenty more interesting stuff to discuss. It's going to be\nmostly an overview talk. Blender's python integration could possibly span 3\nseparate talks, especially considering the blender game engine's use of it,\nwhich is a separate but interesting talk.\"\n\nChiPy is a group of Chicago Python Programmers, l33t, and n00bs. Meetings are\nheld monthly at various locations around Chicago. Also, ChiPy is a proud\nsponsor of many Open Source and Educational efforts in Chicago. Stay tuned to\nthe mailing list for more info.
