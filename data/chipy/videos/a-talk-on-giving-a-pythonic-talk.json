  "description": "Xan Vongsathorn and Catherine Vongsathorn will be giving a talk about talks. It turns out that many of python's core principles apply very well to presentations -- or for that matter, communication more generally -- which may be why we like python so much. Xan and Catherine want to get people excited not only about giving talks but also about using them to *actually communicate*. You don\u2019t have to be an expert, nor do you need natural talent, to give a good talk; this metatalk will discuss guiding principles that set effective presentations apart and can be applied to any technical talk.",
