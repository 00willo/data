  "summary": "Marmir (https://github.com/brianray/mm) takes Python data structures and\nturns them into spreadsheets (think xlwt on steroids). This is a high\nlevel Intro to the project, current status, goals, and to solicit any\ncontributions. This talk will look into how Marmir internals do things\nlike: measure fonts to fit columns, preserve data types (dates,\nnumbers), allow advanced look and feel customization of spreadsheets.\nLater down the road, I would like to have a separate talk on Marmir\ninternals and how it may be customized to do things like, convert Django\nmodel data directly to spreadsheets, integrate with google spreadsheets.\n",
