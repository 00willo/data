  "summary": "We present two outreach programmes run by Sydney University for high school\nstudents: the National Computer Science School (http://www.ncss.edu.au) and\nthe Girls' Programming Network (http://sydney.edu.au/it/gpn). For the past\nfour years we have been teaching Python to students in grades 9-12, and based\non this experience we will discuss why Python is a good first language and the\nparts of it which are still difficult for students to grasp.\n\n",
