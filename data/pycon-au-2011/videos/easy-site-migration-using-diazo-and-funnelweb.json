  "summary": "Moving old sites into a new web platform is a pain. Often you need to\npull apart perfectly good HTML just to spend time painstakingly putting\nback together again and converting hundreds of pages of content is a\nchore. Recently PretaWeb used tools to drastically simplify this process\nwhen converting genetics.edu.au to Plone 4.1. Diazo is a platform\nindependent theming engine that leaves HTML untouched. Funnelweb is a\nstatic content migration tool for crawling and manipulating site\ncontent.\n",
