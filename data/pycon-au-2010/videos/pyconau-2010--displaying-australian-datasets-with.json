  "summary": "",
  "description": "Displaying Australian datasets with Django\n\nPresented by Malcolm Tredinnick\n\nThe last 18 months or so in Australia have seen an increased number of\ngovernment and public sector organisations releasing datasets to the\npublic under reasonable reuse terms (often Creative Commons license).\nThis talk will take a couple of those local real-world datasets and\ncreate a minimal website for remixing them, using Django as the\nunderlying framework. The goals are to provide a short walk through the\nprocess of importing and extracting such data in practice, show how to\nincorporate Django's GIS features into an application, as well as\nhighlighting that real world is messy and so is the data it produces.\nWorking with datasets for journalism or research purposes, or simply\nfun, requires a certain attention to detail.\n\nBasic knowledge of Django is assumed, although the GIS components will\nbe introduced carefully as they are less familiar to many developers.\n",
