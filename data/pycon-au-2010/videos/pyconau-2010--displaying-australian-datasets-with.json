  "description": "Displaying Australian datasets with Django\n\nPresented by Malcolm Tredinnick\n\nThe last 18 months or so in Australia have seen an increased number of\ngovernment and public sector organisations releasing datasets to the public\nunder reasonable reuse terms (often Creative Commons license). This talk will\ntake a couple of those local real-world datasets and create a minimal website\nfor remixing them, using Django as the underlying framework. The goals are to\nprovide a short walk through the process of importing and extracting such data\nin practice, show how to incorporate Django's GIS features into an\napplication, as well as highlighting that real world is messy and so is the\ndata it produces. Working with datasets for journalism or research purposes,\nor simply fun, requires a certain attention to detail.\n\nBasic knowledge of Django is assumed, although the GIS components will be\nintroduced carefully as they are less familiar to many developers.\n\n",
