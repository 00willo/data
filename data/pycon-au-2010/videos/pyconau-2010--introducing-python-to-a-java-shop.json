In this talk we see how Python was introduced to a Java shop as a\nvehicle for rapid and dynamic prototyping of a new project. The talk then\nexplains how Jython/Java integration was used to translate this project step\nby step from Python to Java. Going beyond the advocacy focus, the talk then\nshows the interfaces to call Java from Python and vice versa and illustrates\nthose with examples. Furthermore, unit testing of Java classes via test cases\nwritten in Python is also touched upon.\n\n", "video_mp4_url": null, "tags": ["advocacy", "jython", "prototyping", "pyconau", "pyconau2010"], "copyright_text": "Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 3.0", "related_urls": [], "video_flv_download_only": false, "source_url": "", "video_webm_url": null, "video_ogv_length": null, "video_ogv_url": null, "language": "English", "video_webm_length": null, "summary": "", "thumbnail_url": "http://a.images.blip.tv/Pyconau-IntroducingPythonToAJavaShop731.png", "video_flv_url": "http://05d2db1380b6504cc981-8cbed8cf7e3a131cd8f1c3e383d10041.r93.cf2.rackcdn.com/pycon-au-2010/456_pyconau-2010-introducing-python-to-a-java-shop.flv"}
