  "description": "Python Goes to the Movies\n\nPresented by Mark J Streatfield (Dr. D. Studios.)\n\nAs Hollywood continues to churn out blockbuster films such as Avatar, the\ntechnology used to produce the eye popping visual effects is increasingly\nbecoming the nomenclature of the everyday movie-goer. While attention is often\npaid to the headline techniques such as motion capture and complex physics\nsimulation, few realise that the majority of the work is underpinned by a\nfoundation of Python. This talk introduces the application of Python in the\nvisual effects industry.\n\n",
