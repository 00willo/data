  "description": "Fast Engineering Computation in with Boost::Python and Numarray\n\nPresented by Filip Zalio (NEC Australia)\n\nIn the 3G Mobile Research and Development Division in NEC Australia\n(www.nec.com.au) we have been using Python based environment since 2005. We\nrun digital signal processing simulations of 3G and 4G mobile phone radio\nlinks. Our simulations are CPU-bound, where efficient and fast interfacing\nbetween C++ and Python is one of the keys to the growing success of Python\nwithin NEC. In this short presentation, we describe our current framework\nwhich achieves the fast processing.\n\n",
