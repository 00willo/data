Are the serfs in the\nfields of development teams rebelling against the rightful King of the Realm?\n\nIs the Dynamic Language Runtime from Microsoft merely a French castle in the\nKingdom of England?\n\nHow does this all fit with the open source Knights of Ni that lurk in the\nthickest of forests?\n\nAnd the so-called Holy Hand Grenade of Antioch, Ruby, really a weapon of mass\ndestruction?\n\nFind out in Nick Hodge's keynote.\n\nA Professional Geek at Microsoft in Australia, Nick spends his time with open\nsource communities showing off Microsoft open source cool and shiny toys.\nPrior to Microsoft, Nick spent many a weekend over 3 years building an\ninternal sales management tool using Python, Excel and SAP to counter-act the\nevilness of being a sales manager. Please do not ask about these dark times in\npolite conversations.
