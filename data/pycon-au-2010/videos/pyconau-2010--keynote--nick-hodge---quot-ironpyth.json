  "description": "Keynote: Nick Hodge, \"IronPython & The Quest for the Holy Grail\"\n\nPresented by Nick Hodge\n\nLanguage interoperability is one of the Holy Grails of programming\nlanguages. Choose your language, choose your framework and freely\nexchange objects and methods.\n\nIs this Anarcho-syndicalism of application architecture? Are the serfs\nin the fields of development teams rebelling against the rightful King\nof the Realm?\n\nIs the Dynamic Language Runtime from Microsoft merely a French castle in\nthe Kingdom of England?\n\nHow does this all fit with the open source Knights of Ni that lurk in\nthe thickest of forests?\n\nAnd the so-called Holy Hand Grenade of Antioch, Ruby, really a weapon of\nmass destruction?\n\nFind out in Nick Hodge's keynote.\n\nA Professional Geek at Microsoft in Australia, Nick spends his time with\nopen source communities showing off Microsoft open source cool and shiny\ntoys. Prior to Microsoft, Nick spent many a weekend over 3 years\nbuilding an internal sales management tool using Python, Excel and SAP\nto counter-act the evilness of being a sales manager. Please do not ask\nabout these dark times in polite conversations. More info about Nick may\nor may not be found at http://www.nickhodge.com/.\n",
