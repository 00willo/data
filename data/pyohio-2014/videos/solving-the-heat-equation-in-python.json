  "title": "Solving the Heat Equation in Python!", 
  "summary": "In this talk we will solve two partial differential equations by using a very small subset of numpy, scipy, matplotlib, and python. We will then use a couple of techniques to generate beautiful animations of the solutions we find. The listeners will see how easy it is to get serious work done with only a beginner's knowledge of Python. ",
