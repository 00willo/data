  "title": "Managing scientific simulations with Python with RQ (Redis Queue)",
  "summary": "Writing scientific software in support of experimentation and simulation\nis a challenging task. It is even more challenging in cases where such\nsoftware must be distributed across multiple machines. Existing methods\nfor addressing this problem can require either significant effort to\nmaintain and extend. Alternative approaches such as message queues can\nbe incredibly difficult to install for novices.\n\nThis presentation will demonstrate a quick and easy approach to solving\nthis problem using the redis-queue module. This approach makes it easy\nto make efficient use of multiple cores and multiple machines, with only\nminimal dependence on external packages.\n",
