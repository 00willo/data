But what about testing your web applications, javascript and all?  Selenium is good but can be verbose and clunky.  Kill off test bloat and make your tests elegant and deadly, with Splinter.\r\n\r\nSplinter is a DSL for writing web app integration tests.  It wraps Selenium Webdriver or Zope Testdriver, supports Javascript and AJAX, supports css and xpath selectors and provides a clean, easily read API.\r\n\r\nIn this talk we'll look at installing, configuring and using Splinter.  We'll cover common tasks, selectors and executing javascript.  Suitable for those new to selenium and those who are frustrated by it, this talk aims to get you interested and remove one of the excuses for not testing more.", "thumbnail_url": "http://i1.ytimg.com/vi/ihjpKPRDlVw/hqdefault.jpg", "video_flv_url": null}
