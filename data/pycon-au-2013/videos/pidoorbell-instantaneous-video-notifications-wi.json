  "summary": "Have you ever found yourself obsessively checking the UPS or FedEx tracking site to see if your package finally got delivered at your doorstep?  Or wondered when your contractor/gardener showed up to do their job?  Or if your neighbor came looking for you on an urgent matter while you were out?\r\n\r\nIn this talk, I will show you how you can relax and rely on your handy-dandy smartphone to let you know when these events happen along with video snippets of what happened and who showed up!
