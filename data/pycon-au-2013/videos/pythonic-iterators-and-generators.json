  "title": "Pythonic iterators and generators",
  "summary": "One of the first things you learn in programming is to apply a series of\ninstructions to a set of elements.\n\nGiven it's ubiquitous nature and given the culture of python to simplify\nsuch tasks, decades of development and thought has gone into making this\nas convenient as possible for all possible use cases. While the\nfunctional ways of iterating like map, reduce and filter exist,\nlist-comprehensions and the functions in itertools module enable several\npythonic imperative alternatives that cover a gamut of possible use\ncases.\n\nThis talk is an interactive exercise using iPython notebook to cover\nmany of these use cases to enable better iteration including writing of\nyour own iterators and generators and when you would want to do such a\nthing.\n",
