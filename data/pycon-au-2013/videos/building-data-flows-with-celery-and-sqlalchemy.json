  "title": "Building data flows with Celery and SQLAlchemy",
  "summary": "Reporting and analysis systems rely on coherent and reliable data, often\nfrom disparate sources. To that end, a series of well established data\nwarehousing practices have emerged to extract data and produce a\nconsistent data store.\n\nThis talk will look at some options for composing workflows using\nPython. In particular, we'll explore beyond Celery's asynchronous task\nprocessing functionality into its workflow (aka Canvas) system and how\nit can be used in conjunction with SQLAlchemy's architecture to provide\nthe building blocks for data stream processing.\n",
