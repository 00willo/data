  "summary": "The web is a scary place, and building secure web applications is difficult. Luckily, you've got Python! The Python web community tends to take security seriously, so most popular Python web frameworks have defenses available. This talk looks at the list of the top 10 security vulnerabilities, as ranked by The Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP). We'll talk about what each attack is, and look at how to defend against them using three popular Python web frameworks -- Django, Pyramid, and Flask.",
