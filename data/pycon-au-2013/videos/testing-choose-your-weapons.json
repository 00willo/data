  "summary": "A good suite of tests is a programmer's best friend. But a poorly designed testing strategy can result in tests that are unwieldy, fragile, and above all no fun to write or maintain.\r\n\r\nThis talk will offer a smorgasbord of testing ideas, ranging from simple tips and tricks to fully-fledged testing frameworks for Python. We will touch on automation, table-based testing, round-trip testing, UI testing, property checking, testing Twisted Python applications, and more. Be prepared to think outside the box, as we will see that testing is an area where creativity and pragmatism pay off better than following a rigid set of rules.\r\n\r\nEveryone should come away with a few new ideas, and renewed enthusiasm for test-driven development!",
