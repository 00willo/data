  "summary": "Social app development challenges us to code for users\u2019 personal world. Users are giving push-back to ill-fitted assumptions about their own identity \u2014 name, gender, sexual orientation, important relationships, and many other attributes that are individually meaningful.\r\n\r\nHow can we balance users\u2019 realities with an app\u2019s business requirements?\r\n\r\nFacebook, Google+, and others are struggling with these questions. Resilient approaches arise from an app\u2019s own foundation. Discover how our earliest choices influence codebase, UX, and development itself. Learn how we can use that knowledge to both inspire the people who use our apps, and to generate the data that need as developers.",
