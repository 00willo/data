  "summary": "What are the key features of a modern dynamic language like Python that\r\nlet a programmer make progress even against difficult problems, even on\r\ndays when things are not going well?  Starting simple and then ramping\r\nup to complex, Brandon takes us from how beginners can use a Python\r\ndictionary to pair up matching data, to how to use ctypes to work around\r\nlimitations in the built-in Python SSL module, as he takes us through\r\nthe tools and approaches that for a Python programmer are all part of a\r\nday's work \u2014 the features without which we would not be as productive.",
