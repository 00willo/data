  "title": "Saturday Morning BreakfastSerial: Hacking Arduinos in Python", 
  "summary": "Normally when you want to hack on a sweet hardware project, you bust out your Arduino and start coding in what may as well be C. We as Python developers know that sucks! Introducing BreakfastSerial, a framework that makes it super simple to interact with Arduinos using just Python. In this session, you'll learn the basics, see some fun demos, and become a hardware-hacking pro in no time flat.",
