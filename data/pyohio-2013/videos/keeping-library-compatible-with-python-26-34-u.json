  "summary": "How hard is it to port a library to python 3? How much work is it going forward? Based on two examples (a pure Python, and a C-extension-based library), I want to show how in my experience the work required is modest, without significant impact on old code.  At the same time, keeping Python2 compatibility constrains development under Python 3 because only the common subset of features can be used.",
