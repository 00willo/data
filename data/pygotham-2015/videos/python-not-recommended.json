  "description": "At Braintree, we've moved away from using Python. We've always used Ruby as our primary language, but Python used to be the go-to choice for things where Ruby wasn't a good fit. I will discuss the problems we've had with Python, why we decided to move to other solutions, and what we've chosen instead. Finally, I'll talk about where we're continuing to use Python and what the future holds.  ",
