  "description": "We've been told to stop writing objects. We've been told to write more objects.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, we cover the Python datamodel, when to begin writing objects,\r\nwhat methods to start with that leverage the Python data model, and how to use\r\nthe \"magic\" methods of Python. This talk assumes you know a few of the basic\r\nbuiltin data structures of Python (dicts) and have at least passing familiarity with\r\noperators (+, -, * , /, in, etc...)\r\n\r\nWhich should we be doing? When? How?\r\n",
