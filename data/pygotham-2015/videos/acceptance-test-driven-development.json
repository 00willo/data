  "description": "Python offers excellent frameworks for unit and integration testing. However, many people don't realize that Python also has tools that have been built for Acceptance Test Driven Development. This talk will focus on Behave, an acceptance test development tool similar to Cucumber. Behave uses Python and Selenium, making available the libraries of both to create robust testing for front end applications.",
