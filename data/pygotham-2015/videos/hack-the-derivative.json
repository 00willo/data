  "summary": "", 
  "description": "Numerical estimates of the derivative of a function are typically done using an approximation called \"Finite Difference.\" However, the accuracy of this method is computationally bounded. Using Complex Analysis, we're able to take the step in the imaginary direction on the complex plane and achieve near perfect estimation of the derivative in only three lines of code!  \r\n",
