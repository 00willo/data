  "summary": "", 
  "description": "The LLVM Compiler Infrastructure Project provides a convenient, transportable intermediate representation (LLVM-IR) which can be compiled and linked into multiple types of machine-dependent assembly code. TupleWare is a new analytical framework built at Brown University that allows users to compile functions into distributed programs that are automatically deployed. TupleWare compiles user functions to LLVM-IR, and C++ code is generated and applied to the data through the distributed framework. This talk will go through the steps of writing a comprehensive Python front-end for TupleWare with a focus on the construction of a compiler from a limited subset of Python to LLVM-IR.",
