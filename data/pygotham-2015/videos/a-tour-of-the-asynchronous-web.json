  "description": "Learn the difference between synchronous and asynchronous web frameworks, why you would want asynchronicity, and some of the ways to achieve it. We will also explore some of the currently available asynchronous web frameworks, compare simple example applications written in each, and take a quick look at how they perform under different flavors of Python - 2.7, 3, and PyPy.",
