We'll dig into the different types of\nDjango applications and coding patterns that make writing a reusable\napplication easier. The talk also covers ways to avoid common implementation\ngotchas.\n\nAbstract\n\nReusable, or pluggable, applications are a powerful feature of Django. Your\ncode can do more if written with a few ideas and techniques in mind. We'll\ncover:\n\n  * The four qualities of a pluggable application \n  * The three types of Django applications \n  * Ten common situations in implementing reusable code and coding patterns to handle them \n\n",
