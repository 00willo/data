These modules and\ntechniques provide the foundation for developer's tools such as\nautocompletion IDE's, code analysis tools, test runners, profilers, and\nso on.\n\nI'll delve into a number of the common techniques used to write\nPython-Aware Python. Each has its area of applicability and its\nstrengths and weaknesses. I'll demonstrate small samples that show how\nthose techniques underlie the tools we all know and love.\n\nThe world of Python tools is ready for new exploration. This talk will\ngive you the foundation you need to write the next great Python-aware\napplication.\n",
