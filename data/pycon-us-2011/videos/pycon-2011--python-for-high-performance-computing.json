  "description": "Python for High Performance Computing\n\nPresented by William Scullin\n\nPython is becoming increasingly popular within the high performance\ncomputing community. While it initially gained traction as a scripting\nlanguage, Python's role has continued to expand with Python applications\nfor science scaling to hundreds of thousands of cores and bindings to\nhigh performance libraries becoming commonplace. This talk is meant as\nan overview of Python's role in the HPC space.\n\nAbstract\n\nThis talk is focused on raising awareness of Python in the high\nperformance computing space. Specific topics include:\n\n-  building the Python interpreter for speed\n-  an overview of bindings to numerical libraries\n-  using GPUs and accelerators with Python\n-  scaling codes with MPI\n-  issues when scaling on very large systems\n-  an overview of successful science codes\n-  a live demonstration of Python running on 163,840 cores\n\n",
