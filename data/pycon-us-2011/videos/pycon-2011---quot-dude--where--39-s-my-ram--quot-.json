  "description": "\"Dude, Where's My RAM?\" - A deep dive into how Python uses memory\n\nPresented by Dave Malcolm\n\nThis talk will give a deep dive into how CPython uses memory. I'll be\ndemonstrating a new tool I've written that analyses CPython's memory\nusage, and offer hints and tips on how you can reduce the memory\nfootprint of your Python programs.\n\nAbstract\n\nIs your Python program using too much memory? This talk will give a deep\ndive into how CPython uses memory - starting from objects in your Python\ncode, down through the various implementations layers, eventually\nreaching actual hardware.\n\nIn particular, I'll be demonstrating a new tool I've written that can\ntrack CPython's memory usage down to the level of individual bytes, and\noffer hints and tips on how you can reduce the memory footprint of your\nPython programs.\n",
