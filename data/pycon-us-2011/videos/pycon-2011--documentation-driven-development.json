Writing the\ndocumentation before writing the code, can lead to better code, better\nimplementation and, of course, actual documentation.\n\nAbstract\n\n\"Documentation Driven Design\" was coined by our team after noticing how\ndocumenting code dramatically changed how we approached problems. By writing\nthe documentation first, you saw the problem from a different perspective: the\nend user or programmer. This talk will focus on a few items:\n\nUsable, not just functional. Many times developers write code that solves the\nproblem, but is a real pain in the neck to use. Writing the documentation\nfirst demonstrates how easy or difficult it is to implement the solution right\naway.\n\nA guide to what to write. Many developers leave documentation undone because\nthey don't know how to approach it. Having some idea of what needs writing can\nmake the task seem less daunting.\n\n", "video_mp4_url": "http://05d2db1380b6504cc981-8cbed8cf7e3a131cd8f1c3e383d10041.r93.cf2.rackcdn.com/pycon-us-2011/441_documentation-driven-development.mp4", "tags": ["documentation", "documentationdrivendesign", "pycon", "pycon2011"], "copyright_text": "Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 3.0", "related_urls": [], "video_flv_download_only": false, "source_url": "", "video_webm_url": null, "video_ogv_length": 147964892, "video_ogv_url": null, "language": "English", "video_webm_length": null, "summary": "", "thumbnail_url": "http://a.images.blip.tv/Pycon-PyCon2011DocumentationDrivenDevelopment665.png", "video_flv_url": null}
