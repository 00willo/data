Both give you the power to define\na push/pop of a resource for a set period inside a namespace, be it a function\nor a level of indentation. This talk is a list of patterns that are\nimplemented by one or the other (including some clever functions that are\nboth).\n\nAbstract\n\n  * Decorators, formal definition. \n  * Context Managers, formal definition. \n  * Informal definition: both have the opportunity to do and then undo. - very similar to C++ RIIA \"Resource Acquisition Is Initialization.\" - Context Managers were designed to do that but decorators are frequently just as good. \n  * Which one to use use when is all about namespaces. - Context Managers manipulate at the block level. - Function Decorators manipulate the function level. - Class Decorators manipulate at the class level. \n  * Recipes on writing decorators and context managers - Familiar examples from Django and Mock. \n\n", "video_mp4_url": "http://05d2db1380b6504cc981-8cbed8cf7e3a131cd8f1c3e383d10041.r93.cf2.rackcdn.com/pycon-us-2011/395_useful-namespaces-context-managers-and-decorators.mp4", "tags": ["contextmanagers", "decorators", "namespaces", "pycon", "pycon2011"], "copyright_text": "Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 3.0", "related_urls": [], "video_flv_download_only": false, "source_url": "", "video_webm_url": null, "video_ogv_length": 127109542, "video_ogv_url": null, "language": "English", "video_webm_length": null, "summary": "", "thumbnail_url": "http://a.images.blip.tv/Pycon-PyCon2011UsefulNamespacesContextManagersAndDecorators353.png", "video_flv_url": null}
