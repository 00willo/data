  "description": "Opening the Flask\n\nPresented by Armin Ronacher\n\nAfter a year of the Flask microframework it's time to draw some\nconclusions, see things that went right and things that should be\nimproved. The talk gives both an introduction into Flask itself as well\nas well as the ecosystem that evolved around it.\n\nAbstract\n\nFlask is a microframework that was born out of an April's fool joke that\nquickly became more than that. Based on the powerful foundation of\nWerkzeug and Jinja2 it's one of the most popular frameworks for Python\nnow.\n\nThe talk starts with a very quick introduction into Flask, where it all\nstarted and why I think people like it. We will look into the design of\nFlask and why it works the way it works.\n\nFurthermore we will look into the Flask ecosystem and how extensions\nwork and have a brief look in what is planned for the future, especially\nregarding Python 3.\n\nThe talk assumes basic knowledge of web applications.\n",
