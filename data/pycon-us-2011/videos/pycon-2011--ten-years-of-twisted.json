  "description": "Ten Years of Twisted\n\nGlyph Lefkowitz\n\nThe Twisted event-driven networking engine is well-known in the Python\ncommunity. However, only a few of its features are widely understood. This\ntalk will be a brief conceptual introduction to Twisted, followed by a survey\nof its features, their status, and how development has been proceeding over\nthe years, with a special focus on the last two years of sponsored\ndevelopment.\n\nAbstract\n\nThis talk will begin with a brief introduction to Twisted architectural\nconcepts; a description of the event loop, connections, and timers. It will\nthen segue into the many different features that Twisted offers, including\ncommand-line tools for running an out-of-the-box zero-configuration HTTP\nserver, DNS server, IRC server, and SMTP server. This will also present the\nrelative maturity and stability of each of these areas of the code, with a\nspecial emphasis on what level of expertise a developer should have before\nattempting to use them. Finally, I will describe some of the features that\nhave been added to Twisted along the way, including some new and exciting\ndevelopments that have been happening recently.\n\n",
