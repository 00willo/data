The presentation will\nthen go through an overview of our current activities, sharing in the process\nhow effective they are in engaging the community. Our plans for the next few\nyears will be presented then a summary will provide advice to anyone who would\nlike to get started organizing a local Python user group.\n\n", "video_mp4_url": "http://05d2db1380b6504cc981-8cbed8cf7e3a131cd8f1c3e383d10041.r93.cf2.rackcdn.com/pycon-us-2011/361_montreal-python-lessons-learned-from-bootstraping-a-python-community.mp4", "tags": ["community", "growth", "pycon", "pycon2011", "usergroups"], "copyright_text": "Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 3.0", "related_urls": [], "video_flv_download_only": false, "source_url": "", "video_webm_url": null, "video_ogv_length": 108545715, "video_ogv_url": null, "language": "English", "video_webm_length": null, "summary": "Montr\u00e9al-Python is a user-group formed in 2007.
