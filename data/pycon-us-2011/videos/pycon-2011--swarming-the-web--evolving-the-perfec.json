  "description": "Swarming the Web: Evolving the Perfect Config File\n\nPresented by Kurt Grandis\n\nDeployed web applications are typically run on top of stacks of highly\nconfigurable middleware. The number of tunable parameters and their impact are\nrarely fully explored. Using SciPy and a set of common Python-based web tools\nthis session will present a new method of automatically tuning a typical LAMP\nstack for optimal performance.\n\nAbstract\n\nDeployed web applications typically run on top of stacks of configurable\ntechnology (e.g. web servers, interface modules, software load balancers,\ndatabases). Each of these components often has dozens of tuneable parameters.\nHow many times are those values typically tweaked before a final set of tuned\nparameters are settled on? What criteria are typically used to determine the\noptimal set?\n\nThis session presents a new method of automatically tuning a common LAMP stack\nfor optimal performance. We explore a solution using some common Python-based\nautomated deployment and load testing tools and dive into scientific computing\nwith SciPy.\n\n",
