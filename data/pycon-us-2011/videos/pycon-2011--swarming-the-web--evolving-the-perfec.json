  "description": "Swarming the Web: Evolving the Perfect Config File\n\nPresented by Kurt Grandis\n\nDeployed web applications are typically run on top of stacks of highly\nconfigurable middleware. The number of tunable parameters and their\nimpact are rarely fully explored. Using SciPy and a set of common\nPython-based web tools this session will present a new method of\nautomatically tuning a typical LAMP stack for optimal performance.\n\nAbstract\n\nDeployed web applications typically run on top of stacks of configurable\ntechnology (e.g. web servers, interface modules, software load\nbalancers, databases). Each of these components often has dozens of\ntuneable parameters. How many times are those values typically tweaked\nbefore a final set of tuned parameters are settled on? What criteria are\ntypically used to determine the optimal set?\n\nThis session presents a new method of automatically tuning a common LAMP\nstack for optimal performance. We explore a solution using some common\nPython-based automated deployment and load testing tools and dive into\nscientific computing with SciPy.\n",
