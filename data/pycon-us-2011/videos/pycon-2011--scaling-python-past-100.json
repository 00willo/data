  "description": "Scaling Python past 100\n\nPresented by Mark Ramm\n\nSourceforge.net has been in the top 100 sites on the internet, and we\ndiscovered that python was easily able to scale up to handle that\ntraffic. In fact Python is now the core language for all new features,\nand is taking over all of sourceforge.net.\n\nAbstract\n\nThe path from legacy PHP to modern python tools has been long an bumpy,\nand this is the story of how we took Python from a single prototype\nsite, to the core technology driving SourceForge.net. I will discuss the\nmistakes we made along the way, the benefits that sold python, and the\nreal secret behind our python transformation.\n\nA few highlights include:\n\n-  How we abused libraries for fun and profit\n-  How a major mistake made us look good\n-  How the python community worked for us\n-  How we couldn't have done it without Django AND TurboGears\n\n",
