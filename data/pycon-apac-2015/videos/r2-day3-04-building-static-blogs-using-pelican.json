  "description": "Speaker: Quazi Nafiul Islam\n\nStatic Site Generators are now used by many developers. If you see a .github.io domain, it means that their site is statically generated and version controlled. What I want to talk about in this lecture is why static blog generators are so popular and so powerful if you want something hackable. I'll talk about pelican, its good parts, its pitfalls as well as some custom suggestions to make your workflow faster.\n\n\nAbout the speaker\n\nAuthor, Student, Speaker.
