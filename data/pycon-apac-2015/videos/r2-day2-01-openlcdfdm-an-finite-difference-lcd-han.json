  "description": "Speaker: Zong-han Xie \n\nLCD is a mature display technology and widely adopted in consumer electronics. Being able to simulate LCD device is important to understand how it works as well as improve LCD technology. OpenLCDFDM is a program which uses finite difference method to perform LCD simulations. This talk will give introductions of how an LCD display works and the methods used in OpenLCDFDM to simulate such devices.\n\nAbout the speaker\n\nGraduated from physics department, former engineer of  INNOLUX corporation, specializing in physics simulation. I have researched into particle-in-cell simulation for plasmas and liquid crystal optics simulation.\n\n個人網頁連結 http://zhdiary.wordpress.com/\nTwitter @dapang\n\nhttps://tw.pycon.org/2015apac/zh/program/73",
