  "description": "In a highly dynamic language like Python, testing is even more critical\nthan in compiled or more static languages. Like any other code we\nproduce, tests can be either good or bad. This talk explores three\nfallacies of testing, and the mistakes and bad habits these fallacies\nencourage; and shows how to write good tests which help assure proper\nbehavior without impeding development progress.\n",
