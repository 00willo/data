  "description": "It\u2019s not in the OWASP Top 10, but you don\u2019t have to look far to hear\nstories of security vulnerabilities involving deserialization of user\ninput. In this talk I\u2019ll go over what the threat is and how you might be\nmaking yourself vulnerable. I\u2019ll cover the features (not bugs: features)\nof XML, YAML, and JSON that make them surprisingly dangerous, and how to\nprotect your code from them.\n",
