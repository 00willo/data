  "summary": "", 
  "description": "Gone are the days where creating system packages or scp-ing tar balls were required for deployment.  With Pip, Fabric, and Jenkins we've  developed a pipeline to simplify deployments and rollbacks that dove-tails into configuration management and virtualization.  New machines can come fully deployed and ready to rock at a moments notice allowing you to scale out nodes quickly and painlessly.\n\n",
