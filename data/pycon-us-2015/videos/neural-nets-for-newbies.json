  "summary": "",
  "description": "Neural networks have regained popularity in the last decade, but they\nget dismissed as being too complicated to understand and implement. This\ntalk breaks down the neural net structure as simply as possible, so you\nhave a framework on which to grow your knowledge in the space. I will\nput neural nets in the context of real-world applications and share\nPython packages and code where you can get started building your own.\nComing out this talk you won't know everything about neural nets, but\nyou will walk away with a solid foundation and some resources on where\nto go next to learn more.\n",
