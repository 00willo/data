  "summary": "", 
  "description": "Have you built a classifier in scikit-learn with out-of-the-box features, been disappointed with the results, and wanted to know where to go next? This talk shows how to add your own feature Pipelines and how to tune hyperparameters using GridSearchCV. We'll apply this to the problem of classifying streetnames in Singapore by linguistic origin, and turn the results into a colour-coded street map.\n\n",
