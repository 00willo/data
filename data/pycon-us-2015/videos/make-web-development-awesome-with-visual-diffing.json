  "description": "Visual diffs are a great way to check for regressions on web sites which\nmay be missed by unit tests. In this talk you'll learn how to run\nend-to-end tests on your client and server web libraries using a tool\ncalled dpxdt. I'll also show how you can combine it with web-based diff\ntools like \"\"git webdiff\"\" to quickly and confidently iterate on web\ntools.\n",
