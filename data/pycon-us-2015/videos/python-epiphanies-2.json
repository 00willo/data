  "description": "This tutorial is for developers who've been using Python for a while and would consider themselves at an intermediate level, but are looking for a deeper understanding of the language.  It focuses on how Python differs from other languages in subtle but important ways that are often confusing, and it demystifies a number of language features that are sometimes misunderstood.\n\n",
