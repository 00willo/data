This talk will give you the advanced knowledge you need to take control of your git repository: rebase, cherry-pick, bisect, blame, squashing, and the reflog. You'll also get a better conceptual understanding of how git works, allowing you to chain these tools together to accomplish whatever task you need.\n\n",
