  "description": "This talk will give an introduction to text analysis with Python by\nasking some questions about Shakespeare and discussing the quantitative\nmethods that will go in to answering them. While we\u2019ll use Shakespeare\nto illustrate our methodologies, we\u2019ll also discuss how they can be\nported over into more 21st century texts, like tweets or New York Times\narticles.\n",
