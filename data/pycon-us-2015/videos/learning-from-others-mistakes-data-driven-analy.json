  "description": "Static code analysis is an useful tool that can help to detect bugs early in the software development life cycle. I will explain the basics of static analysis and show the challenges we face when analyzing Python code. I will introduce a data-driven approach to code analysis that makes use of public code and example-based learning and show how it can be applied to analyzing Python code.\n\n",
