  "description": "Andreas Kl\u00f6ckner is an assistant professor in the scientific computing group\r\nwithin the Department of Computer Science at the University of Illinois at\r\nUrbana-Champaign. He works on high-order numerical methods for the simulation\r\nof wave problems as well as issues in high-performance scientific computing\r\nthat relate to bringing these methods to life on large-scale parallel\r\ncomputers. In support of his research, Dr. Kl\u00f6ckner has released numerous\r\nsoftware packages for scientific computing in Python, including PyOpenCL,\r\nPyCUDA and the PuDB Python debugger. He obtained his PhD degree at the Division\r\nof Applied Mathematics at Brown University with Jan Hesthaven, working on\r\nlarge-scale finite element simulations of wave problems in the time domain.\r\nFrom Brown, Kl\u00f6ckner moved to the Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences at\r\nNew York University as a Courant Instructor, where he worked on integral\r\nequation methods and fast algorithms within Leslie Greengard's group.\r\n",
