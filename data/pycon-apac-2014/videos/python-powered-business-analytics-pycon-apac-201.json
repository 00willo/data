  "description": "In this talk, I'll discuss how the modern Python stack has enabled innovation in business analytics and general purpose small, medium, and big data workflows. I'll talk about how the architecture of pandas and related projects will need to adapt and grow to suit the needs of the next decade of data analysis. Lastly, I will also give an overview of how this all relates to my company: DataPad, an early-stage business intelligence company.\r\n\r\nAbout the speaker\r\n\r\nWes McKinney is an open-source Python hacker, author, and entrepreneur.
