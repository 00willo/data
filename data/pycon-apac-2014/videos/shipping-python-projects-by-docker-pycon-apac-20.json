  "description": "Docker is an open source project to easily create lightweight, portable, self-sufficient containers from any application. We can easily build the container in our own laptop and then run this container at scale. There're two parts in my presentation. I'll give a brief introduction first. Then I'll build a image for a simple python website by flask (or Django), and deploy it to my own computer, virtualbox, aws ec2, and google cloud engine.",
