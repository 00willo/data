  "summary": "Grace Murray Hopper's famous motto, \"It's easier to ask forgiveness than\npermission\", has many useful applications -- in Python, in concurrency, in\nnetworking, as well of course as in real life. However, it's not universally\nvalid. This talk explores both useful and damaging applications of this\nprinciple.\n\n",
