  "summary": "The Chandra X-ray Observatory has been producing significant astronomical\ndiscoveries since its launch by NASA in July of 1999. The Chandra operations\nteam uses Python for predictive thermal modeling of the spacecraft to maintain\na safe thermal environment. This poster describes the Xija modeling framework\nthat is used to create, calibrate, and compute these thermal models.\n\n",
