  "summary": "Free, Libre & Open Source Software (FLOSS) began as a not-for-profit endeavor.\nFLOSS licenses permit commercial & non-commercial activity, but the heart of\nFLOSS remains in the not-for-profit space. Kuhn will discuss advantages of\nnon-profit structure and how non-profits facilitate neutral territory. Kuhn\nwill also present options for projects that seek to operate officially as a\nnon-profit org.\n\n",
