  "summary": "The email package in the Python Standard library has had a somewhat\nrocky transition into the Python3 era, and still doesn't handle\nnon-ASCII easily. That is about to change. This talk will compare how\nthings worked in Python2 (the past), how things work now (in Python3.2),\nand how things will work much better in the future (hopefully\nPython3.3).\n",
