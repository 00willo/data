  "title": "PBS KIDS: Building a login system for kids and teens in Python", 
  "summary": "Our challenge was to create a login system for little people who might barely\nread, maybe no email, perhaps no home computer. And we had to watch out for\nprivacy laws - especially tough for minors. But these kids want to play games,\nwrite stories, and create online avatars to share and compete against their\nbuddies. Listen to how we developed the PBS KIDS login and moderation system\nin Django.\n\n",
