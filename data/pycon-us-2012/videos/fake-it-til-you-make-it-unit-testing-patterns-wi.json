  "alias": "video/646/fake-it-til-you-make-it-unit-testing-patterns-wi",
  "summary": "In this talk, aimed at intermediate Pythonistas, we'll have a look at\nsome common, simple patterns in code, and the testing patterns that go\nwith them. We'll also discover what makes some code more testable than\nothers, and how mocks and fakes can help isolate the code to be tested\n(and why you want to do that). Finally, we'll touch on some tools to\nhelp make writing and running tests easier.\n",
