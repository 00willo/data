  "summary": "Spatial data are often seen as opaque to most developers, and while dealing\nwith them does require a shift in approach from the data types we most\nregularly handle, they needn\u2019t be the domain of specialists. High-quality\nPython libraries and Python-based applications exist for operating on and\ntransforming spatial data, and for creating visualizations, including maps for\npresentation on the web.\n\n",
