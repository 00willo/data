  "title": "48. Advanced Parallel Primitives in SPM.Python for Data and Graph Analytics", 
  "summary": "Traditional solutions for data and graph analytics tend to be highly\nfragmented, and take the form of stand-alone frameworks. In this poster\nsession, we shall describe our approach that is centered around a suite of\nadvanced parallel primitives embedded within SPM.Python. These primitives\naugment the serial Python language with concepts like parallel generators,\nemitters and exceptions.\n\n",
