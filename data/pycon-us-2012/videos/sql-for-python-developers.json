  "summary": "Relational databases are often the bread-and-butter of large-scale data\nstorage, yet they are often poorly understood by Python programmers.\nOrganizations even split programmers into SQL and front-end teams, each of\nwhich jealously guards its turf. These tutorials will take what you already\nknow about Python programming, and advance into a new realm: SQL programming\nand database design.\n\n",
