  "summary": "Relational databases are often the bread-and-butter of large-scale data\nstorage, yet they are often poorly understood by Python programmers.\nOrganizations even split programmers into SQL and front-end teams, each\nof which jealously guards its turf. These tutorials will take what you\nalready know about Python programming, and advance into a new realm: SQL\nprogramming and database design.\n",
