  "summary": "When a web application is large, it's a good idea to send different kinds of\nrequests to different servers to reduce the content corpus managed by each\nserver. A decentralized load balancing-based approach is presented in which\neach application server keeps track of what it's good at and presents its\nresume to load balancers, which use application server resumes to distribute\nload.\n\n",
