  "description": "From just a gleam in founder Chris Webber's eye to a full tilt media hosting\nproject supporting photos, HTML5 video, and more, the road to federation has\nbeen a wild ride so far. We owe a lot to the huge community of fellow\nfederators whose work on the ostaus library enabled us to start in the middle\nwith our own not-quite-finished spin, Kuneco. Kudos to the GNU project for\ngetting excited about the web with us. We're also thankful for the massive\noutpouring of project love that channeled itself through transifex and has\nmade Media Goblin global-ready even though it isn't finished. Ever thought\nabout switching databases midstream? Come talk to us, Mongo to SQL wasn't as\nbad as we'd been expecting. We'll also tell you all about our minimalist wsgi\nun-framework design and how we think it's working compared to Django or even\nPylons/Pyramid.\n\nWhat's still left do? Smoother interoperations with allied projects like\nStatusNet and Diaspora. Support for more media types like 3D modelling and\npresentations. World domination... in a friendly way! Swing by if you're\nlooking for a new project to get involved with or just want details to take\nback to your own.\n\n",
