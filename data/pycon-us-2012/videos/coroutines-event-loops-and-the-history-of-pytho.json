  "summary": "This talk traces lightweight concurrency from Python 2.2's generators, which\nenabled semi-coroutines as a mechanism for scheduling \"weightless\" threads; to\nPEP 342, which created true coroutines, and hence made event-driven\nprogramming easier; to 3rd party libraries built around coroutines, from older\nGTasklet and peak.events to the current Greenlet/gevent and Twisted Reactor.\n\n",
