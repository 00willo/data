  "summary": "This talk is an introduction to the practice of exception handling, aimed at those without a heavy CS background or years of experience, and who are thus unfamiliar with the technique.  Novices to Python will learn Python-specific techniques that make use of built-in exceptions and the context manager, as well as unusual but Pythonic ways of managing the flow control of their program.",
