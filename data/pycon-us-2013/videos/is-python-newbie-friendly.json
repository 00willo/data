  "summary": "Python is increasingly used as a teaching language for new programmers\nand touted as an easy language to learn for experienced developers. Its\nself proclaimed virtues of beauty, explicitness, simplicity and\nreadability certainly should make it newbie and user-friendly... and\nmostly do. I'd like to talk with other Pythonistas about the parts that\nsuck and what we can do to fix them!\n",
