  "title": "Twisted Logic: Endpoints and Why You Shouldn't Be Scared of Twisted",
  "summary": "This talk will be a survey of my learning experience adding new endpoint\nAPIs to Twisted, an event-driven networking engine (as a Google Summer\nof Code project), with a special focus on the analysis of some of the\nhorror stories that surround Twisted. Right from the asynchronous I/O\nmodel to Deferreds: if it scares you, we\u2019ll figure a way out and see\nwhat the makers of Twisted say when confronted.\n",
