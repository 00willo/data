  "title": "Twisted Logic: Endpoints and Why You Shouldn't Be Scared of Twisted", 
  "summary": "This talk will be a survey of my learning experience adding new endpoint APIs to Twisted, an event-driven networking engine (as a Google Summer of Code project), with a special focus on the analysis of some of the horror stories that surround Twisted. Right from the asynchronous I/O model to Deferreds: if it scares you, we\u2019ll figure a way out and see what the makers of Twisted say when confronted.",
