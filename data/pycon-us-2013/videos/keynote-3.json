  "description": "\r\nRaymond Hettinger, a Python core developer for over decade,\r\noffers his perspective on what differentiates Python from\r\nother scripting languages.\r\n\r\nTen years ago, Python was equal to other scripting languages\r\nin terms of its expressiveness.  Since then, it has pulled\r\nvery far ahead using a number of advanced technologies:\r\nlist comprehensions, iterators, generators, generator\r\nexpressions, decorators, context managers, metaclasses,\r\nand abstract base classes.\r\n\r\nEach of these capabilities were added in a way that respected\r\nthe language's reputation for readable, beautiful code.\r\nTogether, the toolset offers unique capabilities for\r\nrapid application development and maintainable code.",
