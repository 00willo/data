  "description": "Raymond Hettinger, a Python core developer for over decade, offers his\nperspective on what differentiates Python from other scripting\nlanguages.\n\nTen years ago, Python was equal to other scripting languages in terms of\nits expressiveness. Since then, it has pulled very far ahead using a\nnumber of advanced technologies: list comprehensions, iterators,\ngenerators, generator expressions, decorators, context managers,\nmetaclasses, and abstract base classes.\n\nEach of these capabilities were added in a way that respected the\nlanguage's reputation for readable, beautiful code. Together, the\ntoolset offers unique capabilities for rapid application development and\nmaintainable code.\n",
