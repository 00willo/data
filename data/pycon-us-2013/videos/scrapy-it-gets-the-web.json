  "summary": "Scrapy lets you straightforwardly pull data out of the web. It helps you\nretry if the site is down, extract content from pages using CSS\nselectors (or XPath), and cover your code with tests. It downloads\nasynchronously with high performance. You program to a simple model, and\nit's good for web APIs, too.\n\nIf you use requests, mechanize, or celery for HTTP, you should probably\nswitch to scrapy.\n",
