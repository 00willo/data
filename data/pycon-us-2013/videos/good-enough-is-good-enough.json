  "summary": "Our culture's default assumption is that everybody should always be\nstriving for perfection -- settling for anything less is seen as a\nregrettable compromise. This is wrong in most software development\nsituations: focus instead on keeping the software simple, just \"good\nenough\", launch it early, and iteratively improve, enhance, and\nre-factor it. This is how software success is achieved!\n",
