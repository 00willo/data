  "title": "Python 3.3: Trust Me, It's Better than 2.7",
  "summary": "In this talk I will try to convince you that Python 3.3 is superior to\nPython 2.7 by going over the differences between Python 2.7 and Python\n3.3 along with benchmark information to show where Python 3.3 shines in\ncomparison to Python 2.7 (and vice-versa). If I accomplish my goal, you\nwill walk out of this talk convinced that Python 2.7 is not the final\nversion of Python you want to support.\n",
