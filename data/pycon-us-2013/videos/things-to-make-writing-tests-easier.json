  "summary": "Writing tests is often hard enough as it is, without having to keep on writing the same boiler plate to set things up and check outcomes. I've collected a bunch of these tools that are all documented, flexible and have unit tests of their own. I'd like to share those with people interested in using them so they can spend more time writing code and less time worrying about how to test it properly.",
