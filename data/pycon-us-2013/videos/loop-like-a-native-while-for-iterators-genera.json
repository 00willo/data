  "summary": "Python provides powerful primitives for iterating over your data in ways\nthat let you express yourself clearly and directly. But even programmers\nfamiliar with the tools don't use them as fully as they could. This talk\nwill cover Python's iteration tools, from basic loops to generators and\nhow to add iteration to your own classes. Come learn how looping was\nmeant to be!\n",
