  "description": "Creating an enterprise grade application to meet static business specifications is an easy task for a developer using web2py.  Keeping up with ever changing needs of a business, while maintaining core application logic can be more difficult. At Suits + Tables, we have found this process facilitated using a combination of Unit Testing, Behavior Driven Development, and Continuous Integration. Best practices for maintaining Maximum Viable Integrity during iteration and deployment of web2py applications will be discussed in the context of Suits + Tables and other case studies.",
