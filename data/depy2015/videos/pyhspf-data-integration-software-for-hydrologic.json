  "description": "The Hydrological Simulation Program in Fortran (HSPF) is used extensively for the assessment of water quantity and water quality issues. This presentation will discuss the development of an open-source Python package (PyHSPF) for gathering necessary data from the internet and using it to build HSPF input files, performing HSPF simulations, postprocess results and calibrate parameters. An example application of the software will be presented for a model of the North Skunk River Basin, Iowa, that simulates monthly flows over a 30-year time period with a high degree of explanatory power (R squared = 0.85).",
