  "description": "The explosive availability of data is creating unprecedented opportunities in the analytics space. However, not everyone performing analytics is a data scientist and has the appropriate technical expertise for creating, debugging and running code.  This so-called business analyst brings a broad understanding of data analysis and the business problem at hand and does best with user-friendly tools.  What happens, however, if the business user needs to run a non-standard or unique analysis that is not available natively in their analytics software?  Join our session to learn how python code can be integrated with IBM SPSS and how business users can employ the versatility and power of python without the need to run code.",
