  "description": "There has been recent work on the taxonomy of games which are based, one way or another, on real world data. Typically these games help people learn that data or how to cope with it. The traditional examples are simulation games (flight, driving, etc.), while other games incorporate data in such a way that it is beneficial to learn the real world data in the game play (trivia). These types of data-games commonly have a domain specific focus.  We intend to explore the possibility of interactive games which help people to learn data analysis, in general, implementing some such games in python using web2py.",
