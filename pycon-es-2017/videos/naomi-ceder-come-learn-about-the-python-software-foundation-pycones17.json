  "description": "The PSF plays a key role in fostering the Python community around the world. Come find out what the PSF does (and doesn't do), how it works, how the PSF can support your community, and how you can be part of the PSF. We'll describe the membership model and how everyone can be a member, and many people can be voting members. We will also talk about the PSF Grants program, and answer any questions you might have. Everyone is welcome, both non-members and members! PSF stickers will also be available\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/redirect?redir_token=2SuNbsdBC_1sW-eUsiz5-u8vdXx8MTUwNzQ0Mzk2NkAxNTA3MzU3NTY2&q=https%3A%2F%2F2017.es.pycon.org%2Fen%2Fschedule%2Fcome-learn-about-the-python-software-foundation%2F&event=video_description&v=PXD7PJl2DTs",
