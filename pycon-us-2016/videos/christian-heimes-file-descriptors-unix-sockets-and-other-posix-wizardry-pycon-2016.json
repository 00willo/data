In my talk I will give you a quick tour into the I/O layer and process model of Unix-like operating systems. You will learn how to securely identify and efficiently share resources between processes.\n\nSlides can be found at: https://speakerdeck.com/pycon2016 and https://github.com/PyCon/2016-slides",
