    "description": "Speaker: Jay Goel\n\nOne of the hardest questions to answer is \"\"does my program help the user accomplish their goals?\"\" Whether that person is using our website or a programmer using our library, this talk will describe how to write automated tests which map to tasks our users are trying to accomplish. We will demonstrate specific Python testing libraries and evaluate the pros and cons of this approach to testing.\n\nSlides can be found at: https://speakerdeck.com/pycon2016 and https://github.com/PyCon/2016-slides",
