    "description": "Speaker: Glyph\n\nPython is a versatile language, available on a wide variety of platforms. However, when it comes to shipping code to users on those platforms, Python violates Zen Rule 13: “There should be one—and preferably only one—obvious way to do it.”: there are a lot of ways to do it, and many of them are far from obvious.  In this talk I'll show you how to build Python code into something a user can use.\n\nSlides can be found at: https://speakerdeck.com/pycon2016 and https://github.com/PyCon/2016-slides",
