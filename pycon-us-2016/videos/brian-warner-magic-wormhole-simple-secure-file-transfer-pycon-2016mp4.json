  "description": "Speaker: Brian Warner\n\n\"\"magic-wormhole\"\" is a simple tool to move files from one computer to another, like \"\"scp\"\" but without the setup. By telling the recipient just a few secret words, the file is safely encrypted and delivered directly to the correct machine. The talk will explain the security mechanics, the cryptography (NaCl and SPAKE2), and how to use the underlying open-source library in your own applications.\n\n\nSlides can be found at: https://speakerdeck.com/pycon2016 and https://github.com/PyCon/2016-slides",
