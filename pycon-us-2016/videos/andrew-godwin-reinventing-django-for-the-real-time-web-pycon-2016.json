    "description": "Speaker: Andrew Godwin\n\nDjango has long been tied to the request-response pattern, but the upcoming \"\"channels\"\" project changes this and allows Django to natively support WebSockets, running tasks after responses, easily handle long-polling and more. Come and learn about the design, how we're trying to keep things as Django-like as possible, and how you can use it in your projects.\n\nSlides can be found at: https://speakerdeck.com/pycon2016 and https://github.com/PyCon/2016-slides",
