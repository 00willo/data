    "description": "Speaker: Renee Chu\n\nIf you're learning to code, working with data is a great way to implement your new skills. However, before you can do analysis or visualization, you must have a cleaned, prepped data set. This tutorial uses Python basics to unify data sets from disparate sources. It also shows you to write your programs as modules so you can re-use them for future projects.\n\nSlides can be found at: https://speakerdeck.com/pycon2016 and https://github.com/PyCon/2016-slides",
