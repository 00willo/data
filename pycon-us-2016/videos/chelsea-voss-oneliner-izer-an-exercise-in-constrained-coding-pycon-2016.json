  "description": "Speaker: Chelsea Voss\n\nWe'll describe the ideas and implementation behind Oneliner-izer, a \"\"compiler\"\" which can convert most Python 2 programs into one line of code. As we discuss how to construct each language feature within this unorthodox constraint, we'll explore the boundaries of what Python permits and encounter some gems of functional programming \u2013\u00a0lambda calculus, continuations, and the Y combinator.\n\nSlides can be found at: https://speakerdeck.com/pycon2016 and https://github.com/PyCon/2016-slides",
