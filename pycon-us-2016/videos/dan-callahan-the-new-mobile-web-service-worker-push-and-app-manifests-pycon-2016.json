    "description": "Speaker: Dan Callahan\n\nCompared to native apps, mobile websites are at a disadvantage: no installing, no push notifications, and they only work when you're online.

This session examines how the Service Worker, Push, and App Manifest specifications fill the gap between web and native.\n\nSlides can be found at: https://speakerdeck.com/pycon2016 and https://github.com/PyCon/2016-slides",
