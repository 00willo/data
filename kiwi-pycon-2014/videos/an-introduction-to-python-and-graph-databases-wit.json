Graph databases are good at modelling relationships. This talk will introduce you to Neo4j (a graph database engine) with Python. How to set it up, how to use it and some questions you can answer with it.\r\n\r\n**Abstract**\r\n\r\nThis talk will introduce you to Neo4j (a graph database engine) with Python. How to set it up, how to use it and some questions you can answer with it.\r\n\r\nYou don\u2019t need any previous experience with Neo4j or NoSQL databases and very little experience with Python.\r\n\r\nWe'll cover: Introduction to Graphs Setting up your toolbox Neo4j and Cypher A simple real-world example use case with Neo4j\r\n\r\n**Slides**\r\n\r\nhttps://speakerdeck.com/nzpug/holger-spill-an-introduction-to-python-and-graph-databases-with-neo4j", "video_mp4_url": null, "tags": ["talk"], "copyright_text": "CC", "related_urls": [], "video_flv_download_only": false, "source_url": "http://youtu.be/ps5RtmWKwLY", "video_webm_url": null, "video_ogv_length": null, "video_ogv_url": null, "language": "English", "video_webm_length": null, "summary": "", "thumbnail_url": "http://i.ytimg.com/vi/ps5RtmWKwLY/hqdefault.jpg", "video_flv_url": null}
