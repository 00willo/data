And even if you are familiar with one framework, it may not be as easy to spin up another one. The basil project is an attempt to address this pain point. Use cases may include a teaching session where students are learning Python by building a basic web application. Or an experienced developer wanting to try out an alternative web framework. The presentation will look at some of the challenges involved in designing basil.\r\n\r\nThe talk will cover the following topics:\r\n\r\n - standard user experience of setting up a web framework for Python (contrasted with other languages)\r\n - the user experience of basil\r\n - use cases for basil (new developers, experienced developers, teaching)\r\n - existing alternative solutions\r\n - benefits of using vagrant\r\n\r\n**Slides**\r\n\r\nhttps://speakerdeck.com/nzpug/ben-denham-basil-making-it-easy-to-spin-up-best-practice-python-web-frameworks", "video_mp4_url": null, "tags": ["talk"], "copyright_text": "CC", "related_urls": [], "video_flv_download_only": false, "source_url": "http://youtu.be/ynxQ3qF7LwY", "video_webm_url": null, "video_ogv_length": null, "video_ogv_url": null, "language": "English", "video_webm_length": null, "summary": "", "thumbnail_url": "http://i.ytimg.com/vi/ynxQ3qF7LwY/hqdefault.jpg", "video_flv_url": null}
