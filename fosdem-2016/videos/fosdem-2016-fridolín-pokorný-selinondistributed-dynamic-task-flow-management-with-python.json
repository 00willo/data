Celery is a distributed task queue that offers one to run tasks. Selinon gives one a power to define flows and dependencies in flows, schedule tasks based on results of workers, success or any external events, handle errors, trace flow state and actions in a distributed environment. Its main goal is to split task logic (code) and persistence logic from data and time dependencies between tasks in flows that are stated in simple YAML configuration files.", "recorded": "2017-02-05", "thumbnail_url": null}
