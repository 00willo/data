  "description": "It's inevitable that online communities will change, and that we'll\nremember the community with a fondness that likely doesn't accurately\nreflect the former reality. We'll explore how we can take a set of\narticles from an online community and winnow out the stuff we feel is\nunworthy. We'll explore some of the machine learning tools that are just\na \"pip install\" away, such as scikit-learn and nltk.\n",
