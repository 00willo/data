  "description": "Human trafficking is still a huge issue in the world today. The industry\ncommands 32 billion dollars in annual revenue a year (source: polaris\nproject). As a professor and researcher at NYU I am developing tools to\nfight this horrible problem. Come learn about the work I've done so far\nand where my research is going. I will be showing you how recreate some\nof the tools I've made and used in python. I will be covering web\nscraping, text processing, and image processing.\n\nI will be taking folks through a number of web scraping tools that I use\nto find instances of human trafficking. We will then go through\nclassification algorithms I use to determine genuine instances of\ntrafficking. Finally I will discuss image processing and facial\nrecognition.\n",
