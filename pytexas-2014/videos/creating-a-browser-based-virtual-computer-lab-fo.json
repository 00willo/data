  "description": "With laptops and tablets becoming more powerful and more ubiquitous in\nthe classroom, traditional computer labs with rows of expensive desktop\ncomputers are slowly beginning to lose their relevance. An alternative\napproach for computer-assisted instruction is to use a browser-based\nvirtual computer lab. The different approaches to providing a virtual\ncomputing environment for Python, and the associated challenges, will be\ndiscussed. Options for providing a multi-user environment include\nrunning a public IPython Notebook server, or using alternative\nfree/commercial solutions that incorporate the notebook interface, such\nas JiffyLab, Sage Math Cloud, GraphTerm, and Wakari. A virtual computer\nlab implemented using the GraphTerm server will be described. The\nadvantages of physical computer labs, such as face-to-face interaction,\nand the challenge of replicating them in a virtual environment will be\ndiscussed as well.\n",
