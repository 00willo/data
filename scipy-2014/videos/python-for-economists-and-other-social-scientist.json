  "description": "Together with theory and experimentation, computational modeling and\nsimulation has become a \"third pillar\" of scientific enquiry. I am\ndeveloping a curriculum for a three part, graduate level course on\ncomputational methods designed to increase the exposure of graduate\nstudents and researchers in the College of Humanities and Social\nSciences at the University of Edinburgh to basic techniques used in\ncomputational modeling and simulation using the Python programming\nlanguage. My course requires no prior knowledge or experience with\ncomputer programming or software development and all current and future\ncourse materials will be made freely available online via GitHub.\n",
