  "description": "SunPy is a data-analysis library specialising in providing the software\nnecessary to analyse solar and heliospheric datasets in Python. SunPy is\nopen-source software (BSD licence) and has an open and transparent\ndevelopment workflow that anyone can contribute to. SunPy provides\naccess to solar data through use of the Virtual Solar Observatory (VSO),\nthe Heliophysics Event Knowledgebase (HEK), and the HELiophysics\nIntegrated Observatory (HELIO) webservice APIs. It currently supports\nimage data from major solar missions (e.g., SDO, SOHO, STEREO, and\nIRIS), time-series data from missions such as GOES, SDO/EVE, and\nPROBA2/LYRA, and radio spectra from ground-based e-Callisto and\nSTEREO/SWAVES. This talk describes SunPy's core functionality, provides\nexamples of solar data analysis in SunPy and layouts the roadmap for\nSunPy's future.\n",
