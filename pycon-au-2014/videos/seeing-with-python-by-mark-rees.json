  "description": "In 2013 I purchased a Ninja Block (http://ninjablocks.com/) and wanted\nto add a camera based sensor to it. So began my adventures in computer\nvision using python. The talk will discuss the various libraries\n(including PyOpenCV & SimpleCV ) available for python to perform CV\ntasks like motion detection, object tracking & facial recognition. As my\ngoals for the camera sensor underwent \"feature creep\" the project\nrequired it's own dedicated processing power, so a BeagleBone Black &\nlater a Raspberry Pi were purchased and the project became a IoT device.\nI will also share my experiences with developing python CV solutions ARM\nbased computers. If the demo gods are willing, code examples will be\ndemonstrated.\n",
