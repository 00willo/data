  "description": "### PyTorch: a framework for fast, dynamic deep learning and scientific computing\n\n#### Short summary\n\nIn this session, you shall be introduced to a new framework for scientific computing, mainly\naimed at deep learning workloads. The framework consists of an ndarray library that natively\nsupports GPU execution, an automatic differentiation engine that is flexible and fast, and\nan optimization package for gradient based optimization methods. We shall discuss practical\nworkflows, our features on top of python multiprocessing for efficient parallel data loaders\nand finally we shall briefly look at our upcoming just-in-time Tensor compiler to fuse\ncomputations and execute them more efficiently.\n\n#### Biographical sketch\n\nSoumith Chintala is a Researcher at Facebook AI Research, where he works on deep learning,\nreinforcement learning, generative image models, agents for video games and large-scale\nhigh-performance deep learning. Prior to joining Facebook in August 2014, he worked at\nMuseAmi, where he built deep learning models for music and vision targeted at mobile\ndevices. He holds a Masters in CS from NYU, and spent time in Yann LeCun's NYU lab building\ndeep learning models for pedestrian detection, natural image OCR, depth-images among others.\n\n(Reproduced from <https://research.fb.com/people/chintala-soumith/>)\n",
