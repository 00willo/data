  "description": "Las Cumbres Observatory is not just a collection of 18 telescopes spread across the globe, we are also scientific institution and centre for astronomy education. For the last 8 years we have been building and operating telescopes which are controlled using Python. Our unique part has been developing a robotic brain which sorts through 10s of thousands of requests from thousands of scientists and educators, and schedules them efficiently on our network, autonomous, 24/7. I will show how 99% of our operations, science and education work uses Python.\n\nLink to slides: /redirect?event=video_description&v=KvIOORV9QSA&q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dropbox.com%2Fs%2F7i0opxnkl28sk01%2FPyCon2017.key%3Fdl%3D0&redir_token=87JaBaJ9STKdFqVlXXblBwtH-_58MTUxNDU5MzgzMUAxNTE0NTA3NDMx",
