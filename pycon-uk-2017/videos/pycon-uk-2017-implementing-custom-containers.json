  "description": "One often encounters the following situation(s): - I want to represent my data, - I want to read/write, load/dump or somehow get/save data, - I want to iterate over data.\n\nInstead of inventing a completely new class that provides required functionality, it may make sense to mimic or subclass an already existing collection, e.g. a dict, add custom dunder (double underscore) methods and quickly end up with a container that not only serves your purpose but is also very natural to use.\n\nAfter a short introduction in which we clarify some notions, we focus on two sample use cases: - How to extend a tuple to represent data? - How to implement a dict-like container for data handling?\n\nThroughout the talk we will discover some of the most often needed dunder methods that define a container's behaviour.\n\nSlides: /redirect?q=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fcaichinger%2Fslides%2Fblob%2Fmaster%2F2017-10-26__PyCon_UK%2FCustomCollections.ipynb&v=OrbwNQeBFeQ&event=video_description&redir_token=Abrb6m7y60vHppr3dLNdClJLVDN8MTUxNDU5Mzg3M0AxNTE0NTA3NDcz",
