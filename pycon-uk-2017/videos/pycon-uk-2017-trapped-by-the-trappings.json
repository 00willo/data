  "description": "Most of us will be affected by a mental health issue at some point in our lives, and this high-pressure, fast-paced industry can make coping difficult. We all want to do our jobs well, but sometimes we need a bit of extra support.\n\nThis talk will explain why people can struggle and how to change touchpoints like meetings, code review and timesheets to make the day-to-day easier to navigate. We will cover how to start conversations with people in your team and how small changes in language can make a big difference.\n\nLink to slides: /redirect?q=https%3A%2F%2Fslidr.io%2Fkitation%2Ftrapped-by-the-trappings-pyconuk%231&event=video_description&v=Oo74wkIdvv0&redir_token=Py2gnAgusVqAiYyMpH4AOdh8Mep8MTUxNDU5Mzg0OEAxNTE0NTA3NDQ4",
