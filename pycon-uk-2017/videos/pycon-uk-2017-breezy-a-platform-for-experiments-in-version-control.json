  "description": "We are now in a git monoculture in version control system land. Where does that leave us if we want:     A command line interface that doesn't suck     A format not built on (weakened) SHA-1     A way to customise behaviour using Python\n\nThis talk introduces Breezy, a fork of the Bazaar VCS, suitable for hacking on by anyone, with git format support using Dulwich.\n\nFind out how (and why) to contribute, with the confidence of a comprehensive test suite to validate your changes.",
