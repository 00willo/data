  "description": "Mark Smith | Sunday 15:00 | Room D\n\nSo you've released a library! Now you need to maintain it. You want to add features, restructure the code, fix bugs, and maybe improve the library's usability. Your users just want their code to carry on working. That's okay!\n\nThis talk will cover techniques in both code and project management to allow you to keep your code moving forwards without breaking your users' code.
