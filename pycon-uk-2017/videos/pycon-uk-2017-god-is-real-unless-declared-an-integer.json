  "description": "Owen Campbell | Sunday 15:30 | Room D\n\nIn the beginning, there was Axelrod...\n\nWell, in around 1980, there was Prof. Robert Axelrod and his ground breaking work using a computer simulation of the Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma game and showing how that might improve our understanding of evolution.\n\nThe Axelrod-Python team has been working for almost three years to reproduce that work, and the large amount of subsequent research that has been based on it.\n\nI'll talk about how the project has progressed and, in particular, how we are currently wrestling with the original Fortran code behind one of Prof. Axelrod's papers.\n\nLink to slides: /redirect?redir_token=qbx9v5RdY2-TnQYeHSST58pa_218MTUxNDU5Mzg1NEAxNTE0NTA3NDU0&q=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fmeatballs%2Fpyconuk2017%2Freleases%2Fdownload%2Fv1.0%2Fmain.pdf&event=video_description&v=OSFCvv2wpOU",
