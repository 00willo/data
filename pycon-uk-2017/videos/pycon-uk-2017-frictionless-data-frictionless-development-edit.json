  "description": "A common problem in Data Engineering is how to create a platform capable both of importing and exporting tabular data in numerous formats and of maintaining a change history of the data while users update and query it.\n\nTools like Trifacta (Google Cloud Dataprep [1]) provide a turnkey solution to part of the pipeline but the open source Frictionless Data [2] tools from OKFN can provide a simpler subset of these features tailored to your requirements.\n\nJust as Pandas [3] is built around the Dataframe, the Frictionless Data approach uses data packages [4] consisting of a JSON table schema and a data URI. These schemata can be easily generated for any dataset and work well for a number of applications such as:     Validating new data with tools like Goodtables [5] or tableschema-py     Building a data update interface with tools such as Handontable JS [6]     Creating declarative data processing pipelines that a front end can easily interact with via datapackages pipelines [7] and kubernetes [8]     Pushing data into various databases and repository tools such as CKAN datastore [9]     Extending the schema to allow export to linked data formats such as IIIF\n\nThe talk will cover these use cases and compare with the approaches taken by other open-source data science / BI tools such as Datashape [10] with ODO [11] from Continuum and Superset [12] from AirBnB. I will aim to demonstrate that that lightweight web standards like datapackages speed up the development process.\n\nReferences     https://cloud.google.com/dataprep/     http://frictionlessdata.io/tools/     http://pandas.pydata.org/     /redirect?q=http%3A%2F%2Ffrictionlessdata.io%2Fdata-packages%2F&v=oXw81D6eVLM&event=video_description&redir_token=ngESq74ShZ3Epf_n95UorYklg4V8MTUxNDU5Mzk1MEAxNTE0NTA3NTUw     http://goodtables.okfnlabs.org/     /redirect?q=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fhandsontable%2Fhandsontable&v=oXw81D6eVLM&event=video_description&redir_token=ngESq74ShZ3Epf_n95UorYklg4V8MTUxNDU5Mzk1MEAxNTE0NTA3NTUw     /redirect?q=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Ffrictionlessdata%2Fdatapackage-pipelines&v=oXw81D6eVLM&event=video_description&redir_token=ngESq74ShZ3Epf_n95UorYklg4V8MTUxNDU5Mzk1MEAxNTE0NTA3NTUw     https://kubernetes.io/     /redirect?q=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fckan%2Fckan%2Ftree%2Fmaster%2Fckanext%2Fdatastore&v=oXw81D6eVLM&event=video_description&redir_token=ngESq74ShZ3Epf_n95UorYklg4V8MTUxNDU5Mzk1MEAxNTE0NTA3NTUw     https://github.com/blaze/datashape     https://github.com/blaze/odo     /redirect?q=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fapache%2Fincubator-superset&v=oXw81D6eVLM&event=video_description&redir_token=ngESq74ShZ3Epf_n95UorYklg4V8MTUxNDU5Mzk1MEAxNTE0NTA3NTUw\n\nSlides: /redirect?q=https%3A%2F%2Fgitpitch.com%2Fstrets123%2Ffrictionless-pres%23%2F&v=oXw81D6eVLM&event=video_description&redir_token=ngESq74ShZ3Epf_n95UorYklg4V8MTUxNDU5Mzk1MEAxNTE0NTA3NTUw",
