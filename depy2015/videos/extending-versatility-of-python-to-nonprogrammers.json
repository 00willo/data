  "description": "The explosive availability of data is creating unprecedented\nopportunities in the analytics space. However, not everyone performing\nanalytics is a data scientist and has the appropriate technical\nexpertise for creating, debugging and running code. This so-called\nbusiness analyst brings a broad understanding of data analysis and the\nbusiness problem at hand and does best with user-friendly tools. What\nhappens, however, if the business user needs to run a non-standard or\nunique analysis that is not available natively in their analytics\nsoftware? Join our session to learn how python code can be integrated\nwith IBM SPSS and how business users can employ the versatility and\npower of python without the need to run code.\n",
