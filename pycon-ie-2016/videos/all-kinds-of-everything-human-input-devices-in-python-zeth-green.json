  "description": "| Inputs is a brand new module published in 2016 but it is already\n  gaining some traction. The inputs module provides cross-platform\n  Python support for keyboards, mice, gamepads, touch screens, wiimotes,\n  buttons, switches and pretty much any other input device you might\n  want to use. Currently supported platforms are the Raspberry Pi,\n  Linux, Windows and the Apple Mac. The talk is suitable for everyone.\n  The inputs module is very high level and suitable for complete\n  beginners to programming, I will also explain very briefly for more\n  advanced developers how to support a new class of device, but not in a\n  boring way.\n| In a light-hearted fashion, I will demonstrate how to use the inputs\n| module and will demonstrate some embedded/Internet of Things use\n  cases, a digital signage use case and some more comical, imaginative\n  and entertaining applications of the module.\n| https://pypi.python.org/pypi/inputs\n",
