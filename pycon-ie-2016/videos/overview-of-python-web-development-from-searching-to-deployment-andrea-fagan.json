  "description": "| This talk is about helping people new to development & Python to\n  connect the dots between googling \u201dpython web development\u201d and\n  reaching deployment. When entering the world of development there is a\n  huge learning curve. It\u2019s not just about understanding python syntax\n  and writing a function. How does everything fit together? This talk\n  will attempt to introduce the budding developer to the options\n  available and why you may choose one over another.\n| I will run through the following topics: The major python web\n  frameworks that exist. We will examine the pros and cons of the main\n  players.\n| Python itself, Apis vs Services, what goes where?\n| How to build restfully and the importance of adhering to correct http\n  protocols. How does javascript know what to do?\n| The merits of testing and running through the different testing\n  libraries that are available.\n| Brief intro to Github and pointing to resources to help learn how to\n  commit.\n| Highlighting any \u201cgotchas\u201d\n| Deployment tools.\n| Hosting, where to go?\n| How to google for relevant answers.\n| Python community for answers. (globally and local)\n| Hopefully those that attending will have a greater understanding of\n  the whole development system so they will know what to research for\n  each step and where to find answers.\n",
