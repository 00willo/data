  "description": "| The goal of a Balanced Team is to share ownership and responsibility\n  for the success of a project between team members. Each team member\n  has specific obligations to the team and a specific area of authority.\n  Until recently, designers, product managers and developers were the\n  usual team members considered. In this talk I will explore how data\n  scientists can function in a balanced team and discuss my experience\n  working as a data scientist on balanced teams at Pivotal Labs with our\n  global clients. I will consider what obligations and authority a data\n  scientist can provide as part of a balanced team and how this\n  situation differs from the usual jack-of-all-trades type data science\n  work. I will outline specific examples where data science can help\n  user centric design and product management, and where the practices of\n  lean-startup and agile development can help accelerate analysis and\n  data science. Based on my experience building data science driven\n  products with a global bank and European car manufacturers, I will\n  outline what we tried, what worked and most importantly what didn\u2019t.\n| If you are a data scientist or need to work with one, this talk will\n  equip you to understand how data science can be an integral part of a\n  balanced team.\n",
