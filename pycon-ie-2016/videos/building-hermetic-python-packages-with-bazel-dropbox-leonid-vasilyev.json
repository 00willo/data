  "description": "| In this presentation, I\u2019d like to talk about Dropbox\u2019s Python code\n  repository, how we build and package it, so it can be safely deployed\n  to production.\n| Specifically I\u2019d like to focus on the issues we had with dependency\n  management and how Bazel build system, which was open-sourced by\n  Google early last year, helped us deal with it.\n| Also, I\u2019m going to cover lessons-learned and what plumbing was done in\n  order to make Bazel work for Dropbox in development, test and\n  production environment.\n| Key take-aways for attendees:\n| \\* An approach to introducing dependency management system into\n  existing codebase\n| \\* Better understanding of how Bazel works in real-world\n",
