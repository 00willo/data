  "description": "Django is a comprehensive web framework that provides well-defined concepts such as request, response, middleware and view that make our lives as perfectionists with deadlines much easier. What many of us are not aware of is the rich collection of utilities and tooling around these concepts that are part of the famework. Decorators, helper functions and context managers that are used internally but can make life as a developer much easier as well.\"\n\n- Sebastian Vette",
