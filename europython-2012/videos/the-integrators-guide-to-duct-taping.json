  "description": "\u201cDuct-taping\u201d different systems together is a common task, and is\ngenerally regarded as \u201cmostly harmless\u201d. However, \u201cduct-taping\u201d hides\nmuch more pitfalls than a cursory examination might reveal, especially\nwhen the constraints outside the developer\u2019s control are many. In this\ntalk, a classification of the different integration scenarios is\npresented, along with methodologies to identify them and asses their\ncomplexity: those hiding the most dangerous pitfalls will be examined in\ndetail, and methodologies and best practices to avoid them will be\nexposed, with a special care put into considerations about security and\nscalability.\n",
