It is binary compatible with\nCPython and reuses CPython\u2019s object and module implementations. The core\ninterpreter is new and uses many of the techniques developed during the 1990s\nand 2000s plus a technique developed during my PhD. Once the first stage of\nthe optimisation chain is completed (May or June), HotPy is expected to be\nbetween 2 and 3 times as fast as CPython. It will probably never be as fast as\nPyPy, but it might be possible to get close. During the talk I will explain\nhow it works (with lots of pictures), and how it compares to CPython and PyPy.\nI will also discuss whether the techniques used in HotPy would be suitable for\nJython and IronPython.\n\n", "video_mp4_url": null, "tags": [], "copyright_text": "Standard YouTube License", "related_urls": [], "video_flv_download_only": false, "source_url": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6PYnZUMF7o", "video_webm_url": null, "video_ogv_length": null, "video_ogv_url": null, "language": "English", "video_webm_length": null, "summary": "[EuroPython 2012] Mark Shannon - 5 JULY 2012 in \"Track Lasagne\"\n\n", "thumbnail_url": "http://i.ytimg.com/vi/c6PYnZUMF7o/hqdefault.jpg", "video_flv_url": null}
