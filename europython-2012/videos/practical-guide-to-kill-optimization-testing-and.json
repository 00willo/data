Python provides many tools to deal with\nthese topics but by theirselves they could not be enough. The talk tries to\nexpose techniques, self failures/success and practical tips and hints to make\nthe right choice at the right time. This talk will expose optimization,\ntesting, tunning patterns ( and other critical topics ) of a python project\nand try to analyze the options python provides ( such as packages, techiniques\nand patterns/anti-patterns ) to deal with them. There is not one true way to\ndeal with these topics and the main goal of the talks is to provide practical\nexamples/techniques and create an active discussion with the public. Main\ndiscussion topics: Testing ( modules and techniques ) Optimization and\nperformance ( analysis of the problem, profiling and tuning techniques )\nDebugging Deployment and automation Python traps\n\n", "video_mp4_url": null, "tags": [], "copyright_text": "Standard YouTube License", "related_urls": [], "video_flv_download_only": false, "source_url": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UhYXIWmq-3Y", "video_webm_url": null, "video_ogv_length": null, "video_ogv_url": null, "language": "English", "video_webm_length": null, "summary": "[EuroPython 2012] Fabio Pliger - 4 JULY 2012 in \"Track Lasagne\"\n\n", "thumbnail_url": "http://i.ytimg.com/vi/UhYXIWmq-3Y/hqdefault.jpg", "video_flv_url": null}
