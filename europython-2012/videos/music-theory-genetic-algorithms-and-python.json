  "description": "I\u2019ll explain how a genetic algorithm written in Python solves musical\nexercises used to train composers. I\u2019ll also embarrass myself by\ncomparing the computer generated results with solutions by the composers\nJohan Joseph Fux and Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. The presented project is a\nfun \u201cbrain break\u201d based upon work I originally started at university. No\nprior musical knowledge will be required as I intend to explain just\nenough musical theory for the audience to understand the nature of the\nproblem (although I\u2019ll assume familiarity with Python).\n",
