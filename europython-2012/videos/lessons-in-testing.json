With the complexities of large projects, and even small projects,\nwriting effective, automated tests can take many times longer than writing the\ncode and testing it by hand. This talk will explore the various patterns of\ntesting that DISQUS has implemented, and iterated upon over the last two\nyears. It will describe how testing has been used to speed up the product\nlifecycle, improve stability through automation, and the culture shift\nrequired to get there. Most importantly, it will cover the practices that have\nbeen put in place that have helped ease the burden of writing tests.\n\n", "video_mp4_url": null, "tags": [], "copyright_text": "Standard YouTube License", "related_urls": [], "video_flv_download_only": false, "source_url": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=garsUmsZIac", "video_webm_url": null, "video_ogv_length": null, "video_ogv_url": null, "language": "English", "video_webm_length": null, "summary": "[EuroPython 2012] David Cramer - 4 JULY 2012 in \"Track Spaghetti\"\n\n", "thumbnail_url": "http://i.ytimg.com/vi/garsUmsZIac/hqdefault.jpg", "video_flv_url": null}
