Recently network\nanalysis is also applied to security problems in the form of trust networks.\nAlong with the basic concepts, working Python code is presented, both using\nexisting network analysis Python tools and numeric packages. The focus is\nmainly placed on code, which will be shown and discussed together with the\ntheory, with the idea that running code and simulations are easier to\nunderstand that formal maths. Since complex network datasets are typically\nhuge, some high-level optimization techniques are also discussed. Although\nformulas are kept at the minimum, some maths skills are required along with\nbasic knowledge of the Python programming language.\n\n", "video_mp4_url": null, "tags": [], "copyright_text": "Standard YouTube License", "related_urls": [], "video_flv_download_only": false, "source_url": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4OHUDsNrLo", "video_webm_url": null, "video_ogv_length": null, "video_ogv_url": null, "language": "English", "video_webm_length": null, "summary": "[EuroPython 2012] E Franchi - 3 JULY 2012 in \"Track Ravioli\"\n\n", "thumbnail_url": "http://i.ytimg.com/vi/m4OHUDsNrLo/hqdefault.jpg", "video_flv_url": null}
