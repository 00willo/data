  "description": "Spotify\u2019s current catalog contains 15 million songs. Original storage of\naudio and metadata is over 500 terabytes and we\u2019re transcoding 500 000\nnew audio streams a day. At it\u2019s best the system can make an album\nplayable just few minutes after it\u2019s delivery. This talk is about\nbuilding the music pipeline, all the way from the labels, who deliver\nmusic and metadata XML to our system, to the clients. Problems here are\nthe concurrency, massive amount of data, enriching the metadata to\nprovide better quality and to actually deliver 100 gigabytes of indexes\ndaily.\n",
