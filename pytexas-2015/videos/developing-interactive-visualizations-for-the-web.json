  "description": "As a materials researcher, I was interested in developing dashboards to\ninterface with lab instruments and make interactive visualizations to\ncommunicate research results. However, I always felt that my rudimentary\nJavaScript skills were holding me back. A new python library, Bokeh,\nprovides a clean, simple way to make visualizations that are intended\nfor the web while writing none or minimal JavaScript.\n\nIn this talk, I\u2019ll discuss building interactive visualizations using\nBokeh and embedding them within a Flask application.\n",
