  "description": "In this talk I will discuss the challenges with traditional network\nrouting and how they are being simplified with software defined\nnetworking (SDN) and Open vSwitch (OVS). I will introduce a python\nframework called ryu that allows a developer to easily customize and\nextend OVS to route network traffic based on their needs. I will demo a\nfew different topologies and show the code that allows use to customize\nroutes. Finally I will discuss how we at Rackspace are using this\nframework to solve some extremely complex issues.\n",
