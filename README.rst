This is the pyvideo-data repository. It's the last vestiges of pyvideo.
It holds data for Python-related conferences. The data is in JSON
format in a conference subdirectory of the ``data/`` directory.

This repository also holds the ``clive`` tool which we use for data
validation and building new data.

The data and tool are volunteer-managed.
