  "description": "The Enthought Tool Suite (ETS) is a collection of Python-based open\nsource components that form a foundation for nearly every application\nthat we deliver to our customers. In this talk I'll demonstrate how to\nuse ETS to rapidly develop an example scientific software application.\nWe'll concentrate particularly on introducing Traits, Traits UI, and the\nChaco and Mayavi visualisation tools.\n\nPrerequisites: some previous experience of working with Python and NumPy\n/ SciPy is recommended.\n",
