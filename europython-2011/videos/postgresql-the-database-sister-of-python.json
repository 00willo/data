PostgreSQL and\nPython share more then the first letter: their communities have great\nsimiliarities; their development processes are really comparable; their\nlicenses and their openness to academics AND business (on a technical and\ncommunitie perspective) are big pluses. We will have a look at those\nsimiliarities and learn why PostgreSQL is really the database sister to\nPython. There will be an overview of PostgreSQL, information of how to connect\nPostgreSQL and Python; how PostgreSQL streaming replication works and what it\ncan do for you, how PL/Python helps to have Web 2.5 JSON storage and handling\nright inside PostgreSQL. We will show that YESQL is also a valid answer to\nmany data storage qeuestions.\n\n", "video_mp4_url": null, "tags": ["business", "database", "json", "postgresql", "replication", "web"], "copyright_text": "Standard YouTube License", "related_urls": [], "video_flv_download_only": false, "source_url": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YUFLLl8bGE", "video_webm_url": null, "video_ogv_length": null, "video_ogv_url": null, "language": "English", "video_webm_length": null, "summary": "[EuroPython 2011] Harald Armin Massa - 21 June 2011 in \"Track Lasagne\"\n\n", "thumbnail_url": "http://i.ytimg.com/vi/1YUFLLl8bGE/hqdefault.jpg", "video_flv_url": null}
