  "description": "Build tools are not very popular in Python environment. In this talk,\nI'd like to show how useful it is to have one, even if you do just\nsimple web applications. A nice, single point of entry instead of hairy\nshell scripts, fabric fabfiles and django admin commands all over the\nplace.\n\nWritten in the neat, friendly Python instead of some Anty XML jumbo, you\nare about to have a refreshing cleanup.\n",
