  "description": "Building scalable web applications may seem like a distant problem, but\nthe problem is not thinking about it before it's too late. This talk\nwill focus on designing a scalable web application before it needs to be\n(and avoiding the premature optimization dilemma). It will cover topics\nsuch as efficient usage of your database, appropriate caching (and\ninvalidation!), and what the speaker considers as best practices.\n",
