  "description": "Cloud Computing and Large Scale environments require sometime\napplications based on complex and distributed architectures\u2026 and this\nusually means a huge overhead in the design and confusion out of control\nin the code (network wise race conditions, single points of failure and\nso on)\n\nIntroducing elements like \\*MQ and IPC frameworks in this kind of\napplications is the only way to reduce the complexity and enable a fluid\ndesign (in other words: mess-under-control)\n\nThe talk is focused on describing how to design a distributed\napplication in different scenarios, using ZeroMQ (a modern broker-less\nMQ system) as core framework, with examples and demos.\n",
