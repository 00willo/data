This talk will show you how we\nbuilt our infrastructure - using Redis, eventlet, PostgreSQL and more - and\nwhat lessons we learnt from our first few thousand deploys.\n\nSee how we split services into multiple processes and greenthreads; the pains\nof building a cooperatively-multitasking PTY module; how Redis isn't the\nanswer to everything, but is still very useful; how to persuade third-party\nsoftware to work securely in a shared environment; and how important it is to\nhave good logging, especially when you have more than five servers.\n\n", "video_mp4_url": null, "tags": ["ep.io", "hosting", "infrastructure", "postgresql", "redis", "scalable", "web"], "copyright_text": "Standard YouTube License", "related_urls": [], "video_flv_download_only": false, "source_url": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sg6RmIty9-w", "video_webm_url": null, "video_ogv_length": null, "video_ogv_url": null, "language": "English", "video_webm_length": null, "summary": "[EuroPython 2011] Andrew Godwin - 20 June 2011 in \"Track Lasagne\"\n\n", "thumbnail_url": "http://i.ytimg.com/vi/Sg6RmIty9-w/hqdefault.jpg", "video_flv_url": null}
