  "description": "Designing interfaces so that other code can interact with ours (whether\nour code is a library, framework, application, website\u2026) is a very\ncommon and clearly crucial activity, but it's fraught with dangers -\nthere's a lot stuff we all keep doing wrong time after time. This talk\nshows some common categories of API design errors encountered in the\nwild, with tips on how to avoid them when you design your next API.\n\nGoals: to show you how to focus resources and attention to help avoid\nmistakes in API design. Prereqs: experience designing and developing\nsoftware, esp. software which needs to interact w/other existing\nsoftware.\n",
