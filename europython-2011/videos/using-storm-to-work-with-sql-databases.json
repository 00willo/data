It was designed and implemented as part of\nthe Landscape project at Canonical in mid-2006 and was open sourced in\nmid-2007. Since then it's been used in a variety of projects, in production\nfor many years, and has received numerous enhancements and bug fixes. The\nfeatures of Storm will be explained with a series of examples and with\ndiscussion about what's happening in each one. In addition to describing the\nconcepts and features that a developer needs to understand, a variety of best\npractices will be shared, to help developers make the best use of Storm.\n\nThe examples in this talk assume that participants have a good understanding\nof SQL, transactions, relationships between tables and other common database\nconcepts.\n\n", "video_mp4_url": null, "tags": ["database"], "copyright_text": "Standard YouTube License", "related_urls": [], "video_flv_download_only": false, "source_url": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JC5QqVWA8Vo", "video_webm_url": null, "video_ogv_length": null, "video_ogv_url": null, "language": "English", "video_webm_length": null, "summary": "[EuroPython 2011] Jamu Kakar - 24 June 2011 in \"Track Tagliatelle \"\n\n", "thumbnail_url": "http://i.ytimg.com/vi/JC5QqVWA8Vo/hqdefault.jpg", "video_flv_url": null}
