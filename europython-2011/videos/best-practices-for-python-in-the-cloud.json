But just because it\u2019s in the\ncloud, doesn\u2019t mean development and deployment is effortless. The cloud\npresents infrastructure and development challenges in a new way.\n\nIn this presentation, ActiveState's Gisle Aas will share best practices in\nbuilding and deploying a Python-centric LAMP stack(s) on the cloud for a range\nof web-based applications from simple Django site to HPC GPU Clusters.\n\nBased on ActiveState\u2019s experiences, Gisle will discuss the challenges faced\nand lessons learned in building an infrastructure to deploy web applications\nto the cloud with Python.\n\nYou will learn about:\n\n  * Which packages are critical for a secure, Python-centric LAMP stack (and what it takes to build them)! \n  * Tips for developing, deploying, and scaling Python applicaitons in the cloud \n  * How to use Python to connect and build infrastructure to support and manage your deployment\n\n", "video_mp4_url": null, "tags": ["cloud", "deploy", "deployment", "django", "gpu", "hpc", "infrastructure", "lamp", "packages", "scaling", "web"], "copyright_text": "Standard YouTube License", "related_urls": [], "video_flv_download_only": false, "source_url": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nQWVlXlJwp0", "video_webm_url": null, "video_ogv_length": null, "video_ogv_url": null, "language": "English", "video_webm_length": null, "summary": "[EuroPython 2011] Gisle Aas - 21 June 2011 in \"Track Lasagne\"\n\n", "thumbnail_url": "http://i.ytimg.com/vi/nQWVlXlJwp0/hqdefault.jpg", "video_flv_url": null}
