  "description": "At ep.io we built a Python hosting platform from the ground up, designed\nto run large numbers of web applications on a small number of physical\nmachines both securely and in a reasonably scalable way. This talk will\nshow you how we built our infrastructure - using Redis, eventlet,\nPostgreSQL and more - and what lessons we learnt from our first few\nthousand deploys.\n\nSee how we split services into multiple processes and greenthreads; the\npains of building a cooperatively-multitasking PTY module; how Redis\nisn't the answer to everything, but is still very useful; how to\npersuade third-party software to work securely in a shared environment;\nand how important it is to have good logging, especially when you have\nmore than five servers.\n",
