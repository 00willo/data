  "description": "The London Python Code Dojo is a community organised monthly meeting for\nPython programmers in the UK. Variously described as social coding,\ndeveloper training, \"Scrapheap Challenge\" for Pythonistas and \"I didn't\nlearn coding like this when I was a lad\", we've forked the traditional\ncode-dojo format and turned it into something very different.\n\nThis talk will explain and explore what happens in the dojo, how it's\norganised and why various changes were made to the classic dojo format.\nReference will also be made to influences from music education and\nphilosophy of education.\n\nHopefully, by the end of the talk you'll all want to go organise a dojo!\n",
