Hadoop's native API is in Java, and its\nbuilt-in options for Python programming - Streaming and Jython - have several\ndrawbacks: the former allows to access only a small subset of Hadoop's\nfeatures, while the latter carries with it all of the limitations of Jython\nwith respect to CPython.\n\n[Pydoop](http://pydoop.sourceforge.net) is an API for Hadoop that makes most\nof its features available to Python programmers while allowing CPython\ndevelopment. Its core consists of Boost.Python wrappers for Hadoop's C/C++\ninterface.\n\nThe talk consists of a MapReduce/Hadoop tutorial and a presentation of the\nPydoop API, with the main goal of bridging the gap between the Hadoop and\nPython communities. A basic knowledge of distributed programming is helpful\nbut not strictly required.\n\n", "video_mp4_url": null, "tags": ["api", "cpython", "distributed", "hadoop", "jython", "mapreduce", "tutorial"], "copyright_text": "Standard YouTube License", "related_urls": [], "video_flv_download_only": false, "source_url": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyXOP7SJqKQ", "video_webm_url": null, "video_ogv_length": null, "video_ogv_url": null, "language": "English", "video_webm_length": null, "summary": "[EuroPython 2011] Simone Leo - 24 June 2011 in \"Track Lasagne\"\n\n", "thumbnail_url": "http://i.ytimg.com/vi/IyXOP7SJqKQ/hqdefault.jpg", "video_flv_url": null}
