Visixion has developed with\n[DEXISION](http://www.dexision.com) the first full fledged derivatives\nanalytics suite with Python as core language.\n\nDEXISION is an On Demand application that is completely Open Source based\n(LAMP). For derivatives valuation, it uses Monte Carlo simulation - an\napproach known to be computationally demanding. However, Numpy provides the\nperformance and functionality needed to implement financial simulation\nalgorithms in a fast and compact manner.\n\nThe talk illustrates the architecture of our analytics suite and demonstrates\nhow to implement fast and compact simulation algorithms with Python and Numpy.\nThe talk shows that the Python/Numpy combination reaches sufficient speed for\nproductive financial applications - something still widely doubted.\n\n[No prerequisites.]\n\n", "video_mp4_url": null, "tags": ["architecture", "engineering", "numpy", "performance", "simulation"], "copyright_text": "Standard YouTube License", "related_urls": [], "video_flv_download_only": false, "source_url": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c4WltP4-Xlk", "video_webm_url": null, "video_ogv_length": null, "video_ogv_url": null, "language": "English", "video_webm_length": null, "summary": "[EuroPython 2011] Yves Hilpisch - 24 June 2011 in \"Track Ravioli \"\n\n", "thumbnail_url": "http://i.ytimg.com/vi/c4WltP4-Xlk/hqdefault.jpg", "video_flv_url": null}
