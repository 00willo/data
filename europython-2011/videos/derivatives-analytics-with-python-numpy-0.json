  "description": "In financial engineering and derivatives analytics, C/C++/Java/VBA and\nother languages are still dominating. Visixion has developed with\n`DEXISION <http://www.dexision.com>`__ the first full fledged\nderivatives analytics suite with Python as core language.\n\nDEXISION is an On Demand application that is completely Open Source\nbased (LAMP). For derivatives valuation, it uses Monte Carlo simulation\n- an approach known to be computationally demanding. However, Numpy\nprovides the performance and functionality needed to implement financial\nsimulation algorithms in a fast and compact manner.\n\nThe talk illustrates the architecture of our analytics suite and\ndemonstrates how to implement fast and compact simulation algorithms\nwith Python and Numpy. The talk shows that the Python/Numpy combination\nreaches sufficient speed for productive financial applications -\nsomething still widely doubted.\n\n[No prerequisites.]\n",
