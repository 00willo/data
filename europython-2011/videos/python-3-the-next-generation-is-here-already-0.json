But now\ncomes Python 3, the first version of the language that is not backwards\ncompatible with previous releases.\n\nWhat does this mean? Are all my Python programs going to break? Will I have to\nrewrite everything? How much time do I have? When is Python 2 going to be\nEOL'd? Is the language undergoing a complete rewrite and will I even recognize\nit? What are the changes between Python 2 and 3 anyway? Also, the next\ngeneration is already here, as Python 3 is over two years old now. What has\nbeen ported so far, and what is its current status? Are migration plans or\ntransition tools available? If I want to start learning Python, should I do\nPython 2 or Python 3? Are all Python 2 books obsolete?\n\nWe will attempt to answer all of these questions and more.
