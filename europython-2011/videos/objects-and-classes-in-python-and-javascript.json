Beginners can use it without\nunderstanding it all. Experts can use it to produce code that is both elegant\nand powerful (such as models and class-based views in Django). Python classes\ncan be used for many purposes.\n\nThis tutorial arises from the author's experience in using classes to solve\nproblems, such as:\n\n  * Add custom methods and attributes to objects that are, at root, just an integer\n  * Construct dictionaries whose values are functions\n  * Construct classes on-the-fly\n  * Implement JavaScript object semantics in Python (advanced topic)\n\nThe outline syllabus is:\n\n  * Review of the class statement in Python (and decorators)\n  * Subclassing built-in types such as int and tuple\n  * How to define classes without using a class statement\n  * How to define a dispatch dictionary using a class statement\n  * Metaclasses as syntactic sugar for class construction\n  * Metaclasses to provide new class semantics\n  * Review of JavaScript object semantics\n  * Using Python classes to implement JavaScript object semantics\n\nFor Guido on the history of Python classes see:\n\n  * [http://python-history.blogspot.com/2010/06/new-style-classes.html](http://python-history.blogspot.com/2010/06/new-style-classes.html)\n  * [http://python-history.blogspot.com/2010/06/inside-story-on-new-style-classes.html](http://python-history.blogspot.com/2010/06/inside-story-on-new-style-classes.html)\n  * [http://python-history.blogspot.com/2010/06/method-resolution-order.html](http://python-history.blogspot.com/2010/06/method-resolution-order.html)\n\nThis tutorial is for Intermediate or Advanced Python programmers. (Beginners\nwill find it very hard going.) The aim of the course is to explain exactly\nwhat happens when a class in constructed, and to learn ways of using this\nknowledge.\n\n", "video_mp4_url": null, "tags": ["dictionaries", "javascript", "tutorial"], "copyright_text": "Standard YouTube License", "related_urls": [], "video_flv_download_only": false, "source_url": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0tK-Kawx3E", "video_webm_url": null, "video_ogv_length": null, "video_ogv_url": null, "language": "English", "video_webm_length": null, "summary": "[EuroPython 2011] Jonathan Fine - 23 June 2011 in \"Training Pizza Napoli \"\n\n", "thumbnail_url": "http://i.ytimg.com/vi/e0tK-Kawx3E/hqdefault.jpg", "video_flv_url": null}
