This talk doesn't aim to explain object-orientation, o-o design, or\nhow Python represents objects in C.\n\n", "video_mp4_url": null, "tags": ["decorators"], "copyright_text": "Standard YouTube License", "related_urls": [], "video_flv_download_only": false, "source_url": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IIxc4yNo6M", "video_webm_url": null, "video_ogv_length": null, "video_ogv_url": null, "language": "English", "video_webm_length": null, "summary": "[EuroPython 2011] Mark Smith - 22 June 2011 in \"Track Lasagne\"\n\n", "thumbnail_url": "http://i.ytimg.com/vi/7IIxc4yNo6M/hqdefault.jpg", "video_flv_url": null}
