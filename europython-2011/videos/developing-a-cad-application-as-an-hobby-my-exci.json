The PythonCAD project aims to produce a scriptable, open-\nsource, easy to use CAD package for Linux (Cross Platforms).\n\nI start developing PythonCAD in my spare time and now python is the\nprogramming language that I mostly use. I think that will be very interesting\nto tell my story and how I learn python pyqt ,sqlite, sympy\u2026 and how python\nand pycon and OpenERP change my job.\n\nThe goal will be to tell at the new python programmer how easy to use is\npython even for complex problem. I can explain why I chose pyqt .. what kind\nof trouble I have found and how I solve it. Starting from python going to pyqt\nand at the end how to deploy a python application with pyInstaller \u2026\n\nI also explain my actual project OpenPLM an OpenERP module to manage PLM data\ninto OpenERP\n\nsee you soon Matteo\n\n", "video_mp4_url": null, "tags": ["deploy", "pycon", "pyqt"], "copyright_text": "Standard YouTube License", "related_urls": [], "video_flv_download_only": false, "source_url": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqpkB1wv5bs", "video_webm_url": null, "video_ogv_length": null, "video_ogv_url": null, "language": "English", "video_webm_length": null, "summary": "[EuroPython 2011] Matteo Boscolo - 22 June 2011 in \"Track Tagliatelle \"\n\n", "thumbnail_url": "http://i.ytimg.com/vi/OqpkB1wv5bs/hqdefault.jpg", "video_flv_url": null}
