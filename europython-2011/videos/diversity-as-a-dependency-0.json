  "description": "The PSF recently adopted a diversity statement. While some argue that we\nshould do this just because it's \"the right thing to do\", others\nquestion why we, as a technical community, should even worry about\ndiversity. This talk addresses the diversity question, not in moralistic\nor ethical terms, but in pragmatic ones. Studies on creativity and\nproductivity demonstrate the potential benefits of diversity for the\nPython community. Making Python the best language it can be is not\nmerely helped by increasing diversity, but may be dependent on\ndiversity.\n",
