We will show in details how the memory management of Python objects work and we will show a few tricks to track memory leaks\n  * Python code profiling (profile/hotshots/cProfile, design of small tests, etc.). We will show how to measure, profile, and analyse an application to spot performance problems and solve them.\n  * Post-mortem step-by-step debugging of C/C++ extension under Windows. We will show how to setup Visual Studio for debugging, how to see a traceback in case of an unexpected segfault, and how to further debug and solve the crash.\n\nThis talk is aimed at intermediate Python programmers, who have already\ndeveloped non-trivial Python applications but have never \"jumped through\" the\ninterpreter abstraction layer. If you feel a little lost when you see a\nsegfault from a Python program or you don't have a clear idea how memory is\ncollected in Python, this talk is perfect for you.\n\n", "video_mp4_url": null, "tags": ["cpython", "debugging", "design", "memory", "performance", "profiling", "python,"], "copyright_text": "Standard YouTube License", "related_urls": [], "video_flv_download_only": false, "source_url": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J29uIkdmHs8", "video_webm_url": null, "video_ogv_length": null, "video_ogv_url": null, "language": "English", "video_webm_length": null, "summary": "[EuroPython 2011] Giovanni Bajo - 22 June 2011 in \"Track Spaghetti\"\n\n", "thumbnail_url": "http://i.ytimg.com/vi/J29uIkdmHs8/hqdefault.jpg", "video_flv_url": null}
