  "description": "What was my motivation for working with Python after two years of PHP?\nThere is so much you can do. Functions are objects you can pass around,\nyou can decompile functions to see how they work internally, you can\nalias a bound method to a global function and it will just work. You can\nchange import semantics, override the method resolution order, you can\nwrite metaclasses, you can hook into the CPython interpreter API and\nmuch more.\n\nFive years later I came to the conclusion that this is really not what\nPython is about and that a lot of what I did was interesting but not\nnecessarily a good idea. This talk is a 45 minute recompilation of\nthings I really shouldn't have done in the first place. Expect a bunch\nof neat and interesting hacks that showcase the possibilities of the\nlanguage.\n",
