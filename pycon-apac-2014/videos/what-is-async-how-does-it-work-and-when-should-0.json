  "description": "Python's asynchronous frameworks, like asyncio, Tornado, and Twisted,\nare increasingly important for writing high-performance web\napplications. Even if you're an experienced web programmer, you may lack\na rigorous understanding of how these frameworks work and when to use\nthem. Let's see how asyncio's event loop works, and learn how to\nefficiently handle very large numbers of concurrent connections.\n\nAttendees will learn when to use async and when not to. They'll learn\nabout asyncio, a major new feature in the Python 3.4 standard library:\nwhat it is, how it works, and how to use it for high-concurrency web\nprogramming.\n\nAbout the speaker\n\nAuthor of Motor, an async MongoDB driver for Tornado, and of Toro, a\nlibrary of locks and queues for Tornado coroutines. Author of\nGreenletProfiler. Contributor to Python, PyMongo, MongoDB, Yappi,\nTornado, and Tulip.\n",
