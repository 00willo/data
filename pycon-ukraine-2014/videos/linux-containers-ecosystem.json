  "description": "Docker changed the way we do development and deployment. But most people\nuse it as a black box that do the job most of the time. This is advanced\nlevel talk that explains how linux containers work in depth. What new\nperspectives they open. And what new challenges they impose. After this\nlecture you might be able to implement your own Docker or to build more\nsophisticated tools on top of linux containers. It consists of three\nparts:\n\n1. Internals of linux namespaces: system calls and other things behind\n   containers\n2. Overview of different container implementations: docker, lxc,\n   vagrant-lxc, nix...\n3. New security challenges of namespaces with great emphasis on Docker\n   and clouds\n\n",
