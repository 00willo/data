Including clever uses of selenium and webdriver to run unit tests, integration tests and even Javascript tests.\r\n - Considerations of Django use and web security. Including the sorts of things Django does a great job of protecting you from, and the things where your own due dilligence will always be required.", "thumbnail_url": "http://i1.ytimg.com/vi/nTMupredqR0/hqdefault.jpg", "video_flv_url": null}
