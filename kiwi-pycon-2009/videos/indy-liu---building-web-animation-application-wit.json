We are lucky to have made\npython-ogre our choice. Combined with FFMpeg and the boto library, we were\nable to build the whole solution in python with as little hassle as possible.\n\nOutline\n\n  * Open source python game engines; \n  * What we need - Not just a game engine; \n  * What you can do with python-ogre; \n  * Combining with other libraries FFMpeg, boto; \n  * Interfacing with the web - celery; \n\n[VIDEO HAS ISSUES: Sound and video are poor.
