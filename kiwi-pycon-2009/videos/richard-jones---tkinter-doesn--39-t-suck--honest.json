  "description": "Tkinter doesn't suck, honest\n\nPresented by Richard Jones\n\nAbstract\n\nIn this talk I hope to dispel the myth that Tkinter just plain sucks\nthrough the use of some concrete examples of simple use resulting in\neffective user interfaces.\n\nOutline\n\nI intend to cover some basics of getting Tkinter GUIs up and running,\nand then look at some simple use-cases, including: - file dialogs in\nminutes - script configuration dialog - basics of interface design /\npacking - a look at the widgets built in - a look at some of the\nextensions\n\n[VIDEO HAS ISSUES: Sound and video are poor. Slides are hard to read.]\n",
