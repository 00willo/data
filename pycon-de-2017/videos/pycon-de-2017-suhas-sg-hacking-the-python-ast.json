In this talk, we'll look at the innards of CPython, and specifically learn how to modify Abstract Syntax Trees (for world peace, of course).\nRough agenda     [ 05 mins ] --- A brief intro to languages and compilers     [ 05 mins ] --- CPython and parsing grammars     [ 10 mins ] --- Everything about Python ASTs     [ 15 mins ] --- Let's write a flake8 plugin (to understand ASTs better)     [ 05 mins ] --- Metaprogramming, code as data, possibilities and more!\n\nWhat we'll learn     We'll learn the life of a python code, and how the CPython process works.     We'll understand and be able to participate in conversations that include words like LL(1) parser     We'll make our devious minds work towards hacking into source code and modifying it with the help of ast.NodeTransformer     We'll learn to write a Flake8 plugin     A treasure map to dive into deeper waters\n\nPrerequisites:     Basics of Python, must be comfortable with lists, functions, classes     Basic idea / understanding of data structures     A mischievous mind to get hands dirty for intercepting source code and parsing ASTs     A bottle of water to keep yourself hydrated\n\n\nRecorded at PyCon.DE 2017 Karlsruhe: pycon.de\nVideo editing: Sebastian Neubauer & Andrei Dan\nTools: Blender, Avidemux & Sonic Pi",
