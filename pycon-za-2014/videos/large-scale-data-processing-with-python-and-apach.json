It offers high-level APIs in Java, Scala and Python as well as a rich set of libraries including stream processing, machine learning, and graph analytics. Spark is currently one of the most exciting and fastest-growing Apache open source projects.\nThis talk will give an overview of the Apache Spark project and introduce the basics of PySpark, the Python API for Spark. It will then dive a little deeper into PySpark internals, and finally show some examples and a live demo covering PySpark, Spark's SQL engine, and machine learning with Spark's built-in libraries as well as other Python libraries.", "thumbnail_url": "http://archive.org/download/pyconza2014-large-scale-data-processing/pyconza2014-large-scale-data-processing.thumbs/5%20B%20Large%20Scale%20Data%20Processing%20-_000570.jpg", "video_flv_url": ""}
