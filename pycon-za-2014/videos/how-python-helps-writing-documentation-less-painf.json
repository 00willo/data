We all know how useless and frustrating out-of-date or just plain incorrect documentation is. In this talk I'd like to demonstrate how Python can help make writing documentation, keeping it up-to-date and verifying its validity. It can be surprising what happens when other people discover your little-but-well-documented API.\nPython has several built-in concepts and standard tools to help making this easier, such as docstrings, help(), Sphinx, Sphinx plugins, Doctests and generating documentation off tests themselves.\nI'll focus on not only using Sphinx as a tool, but also on how to structure your application/library/tool so as to make writing accurate documentation as simple as possible.", "thumbnail_url": "http://archive.org/download/pyconza2014-python-helps-make-writing-docs-less-painful/pyconza2014-python-helps-make-writing-docs-less-painful.thumbs/12%20b%20How%20Python%20helps%20writing%20documentation%20less%20painful-_000150.jpg", "video_flv_url": ""}
