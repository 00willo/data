  "alias": "video/2568/kneel-and-disconnect-getting-the-fastest-connect",
  "summary": "Did you know that when you resolve a hostname, you can get multiple\naddresses back, and pick any one to connect to? Some of these addresses\nwill connect near instantly, while others might take a long time or time\nout. This talk is about a Twisted endpoint API I built that takes a\nhostname, and returns the connection that takes the least time to\ncomplete, from the list of resolved host addresses.\n",
