This talk aims to bridge that gap, teach practitioners about what research is out there, and spark a \"citizen science\" movement in software engineering. I'll explain how to study your own projects and get academics to pay attention. Together, we can learn how to develop better software.", "thumbnail_url": "http://i1.ytimg.com/vi/vvEY6bhLXsU/hqdefault.jpg", "video_flv_url": null}
