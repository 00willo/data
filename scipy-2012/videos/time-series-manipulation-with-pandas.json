  "description": "In this talk I'll discuss major developments in pandas over the last\nyear related to time series handling and processing. This includes the\nintegration of the new NumPy datetime64, implementation of rich and high\nperformance resampling methods, better visualization, and a generally\ncleaner, more intuitive and productive API. I will also discuss how\nfunctionality from the defunct scikits.timeseries project has been\nintegrated into pandas, thus providing a unified, cohesive set of time\nseries tools for many different problem domains. Lastly, I'll give some\ndetails about the pandas development roadmap and opportunities for more\npeople to get involved.\n",
