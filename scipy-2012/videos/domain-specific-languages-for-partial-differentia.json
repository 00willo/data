  "description": "As scientific computing pushes towards extreme scales, the programming\nwall is becoming more apparent. For algorithms to scale on new\narchitectures, they often must be rewritten accounting for completely\ndifferent performance characteristics. A handful of the communities\nfastest codes have already turned to automatic code generation to tackle\nthese issues. Code generation gives a user the ability to use the\nexpressiveness of a domain specific language and promises for better\nportability as architectures rapidly change.\n\nIn this presentation, I will show Ignition, a project for creating\nnumerical code generators. Python and SymPy make exceptional languages\nfor developing these code generators in a way that domain experts can\nunderstand and manipulate. I show examples how Ignition can generate\nseveral different parts of geophysical simulations.\n",
