  "summary": "",
  "description": "There are various game theoretic models of cheating. I give results from simulations of various models of cheating-in-game-play collected from my own open source python code (MIT). These results are extended to a \"society at large\" model of the result of cheating-at-game-play. I discuss some overt and less overt counter-measures to cheating-at-game-play in the context of online test taking.",
