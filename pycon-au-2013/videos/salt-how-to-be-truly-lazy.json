  "summary": "In the immortal words of that modern day philosopher Homer Jay Simpson:\n\"Can't Someone Else Do It?\"\n\nIf you're too lazy to configure your own servers: let Salt do it for\nyou. Salt is an open source configuration management tool like Chef or\nPuppet but written in Python using ZeroMQ.\n\n| If you're too lazy to login to your servers to run commands: let Salt\n do it for you. Salt is also a remote execution system. A single command\n run from the \"master\" salt server can call tens, hundreds, or\n| thousands of remote servers.\n\nAnd if you're too lazy to install both an OS and Salt itself: let Salt\ndo it for you. Salt Cloud can spin up new boxes for you in the cloud,\ninstall Salt on them, and introduce them to the \"master\" salt server.\n\nSalty vagrants, masters, minions, states, pillars, grains, salt clouds,\nparallel execution: I'll attempt to touch on them all in this talk.\n\nYou can also be expected to be \"assaulted\" with a barrage of terrible\nsalt themed puns.\n",
