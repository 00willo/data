Salt is an open source configuration management tool like Chef or Puppet but written in Python using ZeroMQ.                                                 \r\n                                                                                \r\nIf you're too lazy to login to your servers to run commands: let Salt do it for you. Salt is also a remote execution system. A single command run from the \"master\" salt server can call tens, hundreds, or  \r\nthousands of remote servers.                                                    \r\n                                                                                \r\nAnd if you're too lazy to install both an OS and Salt itself: let Salt do it for you. Salt Cloud can spin up new boxes for you in the cloud, install Salt on them, and introduce them to the \"master\" salt server.                                 \r\n                                                                                \r\nSalty vagrants, masters, minions, states, pillars, grains, salt clouds, parallel execution: I'll attempt to touch on them all in this talk.             \r\n                                                                                \r\nYou can also be expected to be \"assaulted\" with a barrage of terrible salt themed puns.", "thumbnail_url": "http://i1.ytimg.com/vi/-abRRUK19lE/hqdefault.jpg", "video_flv_url": null}
