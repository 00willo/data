  "summary": "A Continuous Integration (CI) server is an essential tool for any\ndeveloper, but with so many different servers out there its hard to\nchoose which one to use. Buildbot has a pretty steep learning curve, but\nrewards with a very light footprint and amazing flexibility and\nconfigurability. In this talk I will walk through the build(ing) blocks\nand concepts required to put together a simple CI server based upon\nbuildbot, and also suggest some more advanced features.\n",
