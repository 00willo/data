  "summary": "Everyone knows that Testing is Good. But what about testing your web\napplications, javascript and all? Selenium is good but can be verbose\nand clunky. Kill off test bloat and make your tests elegant and deadly,\nwith Splinter.\n\nSplinter is a DSL for writing web app integration tests. It wraps\nSelenium Webdriver or Zope Testdriver, supports Javascript and AJAX,\nsupports css and xpath selectors and provides a clean, easily read API.\n\nIn this talk we'll look at installing, configuring and using Splinter.\nWe'll cover common tasks, selectors and executing javascript. Suitable\nfor those new to selenium and those who are frustrated by it, this talk\naims to get you interested and remove one of the excuses for not testing\nmore.\n",
